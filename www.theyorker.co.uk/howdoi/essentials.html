		<h2>How do I find lost property?</h2>
		<p>Lost property should be handed in to any college reception. Items are then moved to the Security Centre on Vanbrugh Walkway. If anything remains unclaimed after three months it will be donated to charity. You should ask at your College reception first and then the Security Centre.
Lost University cards are forwarded to the Information Centre on Market Square, close to Vanbrugh College.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="BlueBox" id="q295">
		<h2>How do I get a TV license?</h2>

	</div>
	<div class="BlueBox" id="q218">
		<h2>How do I get a Young Persons Railcard?</h2>
		<p>People aged 16-25 and mature students can buy a Young Persons Railcard for &pound;20, saving themselves 1/3 off most train fares in the UK for a year. Application forms are available at the ticket office in York Railway Station and in most train stations throughout the UK. Or you can register online at www.youngpersons-railcard.co.uk To buy a railcard in person you will need a) either your passport or driving license as ID b) passport size photograph. To register online you will need either your passport number or driving license number. If you&rsquo;re aged 26 and over you will need to prove that you are a full time student either with an ISIC card or by completing the &lsquo;Mature Students only&rsquo; section of the form and having it certified.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="BlueBox" id="q197">
		<h2>How do I get internet on my computer? </h2>
		<p>The &ldquo;Student Network Service&rdquo; includes over 3700 computers on campus. You pay an annual fee and get high-speed internet all year round, at about 10mbits per second. This is around 200 time faster than a standard (old fashioned) modem. To use this you need to do the following.
First buy a payment voucher from financial services (voucher looks like <a href="http://www.sns.york.ac.uk/payment.html"> this</a>). This is &pound;60 and will give you internet for the year. Then make sure you have the yellow cable to connect to the wall. You can get these free from Computer Services or at the Freshers&rsquo; Fair on Saturday. Apart from that you need to make sure your computer has Ethernet.
Second, register on your own pc at <a href="http://register.sns.york.ac.uk/"> here.</a>
Thirdly, and here is the tricky bit for some, configure your web browser to use the web cache. That&rsquo;s it you&rsquo;re done.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="BlueBox" id="q299">
		<h2>How do I keep fit?</h2>
		<p>The variety of sports societies offered by the AU is a real opportunity to meet new people, have fun, and keep active. Club contact details can be found at www.yusu.org/au/clubs.html</p>
<p>Alternatively the University Sports Centre has a fully equipped &lsquo;Fitness Suite&rsquo;. It offers weight lifting equipment and cardiovascular training machines. Sports Centre Membership costs a separate payment of &pound;25.</p>
<p>Fitness Suite Memberships:</p>

	</div>
	<div class="BlueBox" id="q294">
		<h2>How do I know if I need a TV license?</h2>
		<p>You need a TV license to use any equipment that can receive or record TV. This includes TV sets, set-top boxes, video or DVD recorders, computers or mobile phones that can watch TV programmes as they are being broadcast.</p>
<p>If you use a set-top box with a hi-fi system or device that can only be used to produce sounds and can't display TV programmes you don't need a TV Licence as long as you don't use any other TV receiving device with them.</p>
<p>You are not covered by a Halls of Residence license unless you only watch TV in a communal area. To watch TV in your room you need your own license.</p>
<p>You aren&rsquo;t covered by your parents&rsquo; TV license unless your TV is powered by internal batteries. Call TV licensing on 0870 241 5973 if you think this is the case.</p>
<p>Never assume: watching or recording TV programmes without a license is a criminal offence and can lead to prosecution and fines of up to &pound;1,000.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="BlueBox" id="q195">
		<h2>How do I make photocopies on campus?</h2>
		<p>You&rsquo;ll need to buy a photocopying card from the Library for &pound;2 (pay cash) for which you&rsquo;ll get a pound credit. These cards can then be inserted into library machines standing next to photocopiers. To work the machines call over a library assistant, as often they&rsquo;re confusing or not functioning. Top up your card at the central library desk.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="BlueBox" id="q191">
		<h2>How do I print off a campus computer? </h2>
		<p>Firstly, you need to make sure you have enough money in your account. Everybody gets &pound;1 put onto their account each term, which is 20 copies. If you need more you have to go to computer services, opposite Market Square (under the ramp). Giver them your York email address and pay cash.</p>
<p>Press &ldquo;Print&rdquo; as normal in &ldquo;File&rdquo; in most programs. Then go to the black-screened computer near the printer. Type in your York email account (without the @york.ac.uk) and password. Then follow the instructions to print. The printer takes a while to get going, so don&rsquo;t panic if nothing happens at first. Be sure to log off from the printer computer when you&rsquo;re picked up your prints.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="BlueBox" id="q192">
		<h2>How do I start up a society? </h2>
		<p>To start up a society you have to go to the YUSU Student Centre, which is beside the Roger Kirk centre. Make an appointment to see the Communications and Societies Officer who this year is Colin Hindson. Once he has ratified your society you are entitled to a grant from YUSU, but you will also have to draw up a membership list and charge people &pound;3 to join. There are further requirements to be read <a href="http://www.yusu.org/OLD/societies/explained.php"> here</a>.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="BlueBox" id="q230">
		<h2>How do I stop facebook flooding my uni e-mail inbox?</h2>
		<p>Log into facebook.
Select the &lsquo;account&rsquo; tab on the top right of your home page.
Select the &lsquo;Notifications&rsquo; tab.</p>
<p>This will present you with a list of selection boxes (sadly not the Christmas chocolate type). Facebook will e-mail you whenever one of the selected &lsquo;actions&rsquo; occurs e.g. If someone tags you in an image. You will receive e-mails for each box that contains a tick. To deselect the options you do not want to receive e-mails for simply click on the box to remove the tick. Finally, click the &lsquo;Save Changes&rsquo; button at the bottom of the page.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="BlueBox" id="q188">
		<h2>What do I do if I lose my key card? </h2>
		<p>New keycards are issued from your college porter&rsquo;s lodge. Take an ID with you as they&rsquo;ll ask for your identity. They cost &pound;10 each keycard and you might as well pay, since otherwise it stays on your record. This means that you can&rsquo;t sign out at the end of the year, which you need to do to get your results. Once you have a new keycard your old one is invalidated.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="BlueBox" id="q324">
		<h2>What do I do if I lose my university card?</h2>
		<p>If you lose your York card, you're in trouble. Well, not really, but you can't use the library without it, and you need it for exams, so it's worth investing in a new one. Go to the Information Centre (big glass building near Costcutter) and find the desk labelled "Unicard". You'll need &pound;10 and a passport photo. Then you get a replacement card straight away for use around campus, and a new card within a week.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="BlueBox" id="q198">
		<h2>What do I do in an emergency?</h2>
		<p>First aid kits are found in college receptions. The security number to call in the case of fire or accident call 0800 433333 (free phone). If you&rsquo;re living in Alcuin remember that doors are fireproof, if in Goodricke you&rsquo;re in trouble.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="BlueBox" id="q189">
		<h2>What time does the free minibus run from?</h2>
		<p>YUSU runs a late night minibus for women, but men can also get onboard if it&rsquo;s not full. The bus will drop you off wherever you request it to. It leaves from Vanbrugh porters at 18:45, 21:45 and 23:45 every weekday. The 18:45 run does not occur on weekends. The bus also goes to Goodricke and Derwent porters as well. For the full times see <a href="http://www.yusu.org/services/?late-night-minibus"> here</a></p>

		<h2>Where do I get a sexual check-up?</h2>
		<p>York&rsquo;s sexual health clinic is on 33 Monkgate, which is just outside the city walls in the centre of town. The easiest way to get to it from university is to take the number four and get off at the Gallery. From there you have to walk across Parliament square toward Goodramgate.
The clinic is strictly a drop-in clinic which means you&rsquo;re not supposed to make an appointment. When arrive however they&rsquo;ll need to register you, and then will make you an appointment for six weeks later.
When you go in for the test you&rsquo;ll be asked straight questions by the doctor about your sex life which you should answer honestly. They will test for HIV, Hepatitis, Chlamydia, the clap and syphilis.
Opening hours are:</p>

<ul><li>Monday 1.00pm - 3.30pm

</li><li>Tuesday 9.00am - 11.00am

		<h2>Where do I get help?</h2>
		<p>There are several avenues available at university by which to seek advice. There is a <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/admin/scs"> Counseling Service</a> next to Careers in Vanbrugh and every college also has college tutors who are willing to talk. If you want anonymous help, then there is <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/student/nightline/"> Nightline</a> (01904 433735 8pm until 8am) every night or <a href="http://www.duckslife.org/"> Duck's Life</a>. Nightline has professionally trained advisors on the other end, whereas duckslife offers you the opportunity to share your issues with other students and help them with theirs.
You can also seek advice from the union <a href="http://www.yusu.org/welfare/"> Academic and Welfare Officer</a>,  currently Amy Foxton.
