		<description><![CDATA[I am going for an orange tie, although the other suggestions for the 'cinderfellas' among us are very good haha. Mind you, to find an Orange tie was a damn lot harder than I expected. While I was at home last weekend I tried everywhere for an orange tie. NOWHERE did one. But I rembered that Topman in York did so happy days. It's a bit of a strange Orange but its orange nonetheless!]]></description>

		<title>Nathan Blades on The dating game 2012</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Online dating is a neat idea in a uni setting, if the idea of dating other university students is too close to the idea of "defecating where you eat". Though prepare for frustrations if you're female (There are a lot of creepy guys on the Internet. Too many.) If you're gay and a fan of one night stands, you've probably been aware of Internet dating since the 90s (and if you're ''not'' a fan of one night stands then stay a mile away from those gay dating apps - they're depressing).<br />
<br />
What surprises me is that there's no app or service for 'selective blackouts'. Picture this: you've had a messy break-up, or came second in a pie-eating contest, or just found out that someone in your social circle is a huge racist. It would be great to have a system of some kind where you could type in their name, and they're entirely removed from your online social life. You're invisible to each other on Facebook, their e-mails re-route directly to the spam folder and every photo they're tagged in is tactically blurred. It sounds extreme but deep down you know someone you'd be happy to do that to; don't lie.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that Nigel Kennedy's act is infuriating and makes me want to punch him. And every time I've heard him play Vivaldi, it makes me want to get a kick in for good measure. Is this version different from his previous recordings, do you think? Because I'd force myself to endure his mockney stylings for the guarantee of a decent Four Seasons.]]></description>

		<title>Nathan Blades on A Man’s Guide to Scent</title>
		<author>no-reply@theyorker.co.uk (Nathan Blades)</author>
		<link>http://www.theyorker.co.uk/comments/thread/12146</link>
		<description><![CDATA[Use antiperspirant every day, but use ones that don't have a scent. Roll-ons will do the job effectively and in surprisingly minimal amounts. Spray antiperspirants have a habit of either being irritating to sensitive skin, and more often than not covering you and your clothes in a fine powder that's hard to get rid of. Gross. Scented antiperspirants (Read: Lynx and similar) smell awful. Cologne/Eau de Toilette is the way to go. Do a little research, find one that goes well with your every day products (so scents that won't clash with whatever shower gel or hair products you might use), and stick to it. People you see daily will notice if you change it too often. I personally use Versus Blue Jeans, but it's kind of a nostalgic thing, heh.<br />
<br />
As a shorthand, the saying goes "Use enough fragrance to only be smelt in the embrace of a loved one. Use enough body spray to be smelt by no one."]]></description>

		<title>Stephen Puddicombe on Neil Warnock: The latest managerial martyr</title>
		<author>no-reply@theyorker.co.uk (Stephen Puddicombe)</author>
		<link>http://www.theyorker.co.uk/comments/thread/12145</link>
		<description><![CDATA[Although given Warnock's success last year his sacking certainly seems harsh, I sympathise with QPR's decision. They are right now in a relegation battle and have spent the last few weeks falling lower and lower down the league table.<br />
<br />
In recent seasons there have been cases of clubs struggling at the bottom, like QPR, sacking their manager mid-season, and subsequently have a boost in form that ensures they avoid relegation. Last season Roy Hodgson kept West Brom up, in 2010 Bolton climbed to safety after sacking Megson for Coyle, and in 2008/09 Roy Keane's resignation and Ricky Spragia's run as caretakes manager saw them climb out the relegation zone. And in cases like the sacking of Hughes from Man City and Hughton from Newcastle, which were widely criticised at the time, have in hindsight sparked vast improvement for both clubs. And, most recently, look how well Sunderland have done since bringing in O'Neill. I think, given the calibre of Mark Hughes, QPR will be better off in both the short and long run.  ]]></description>

		<title>Gillian Love on What is a modern man?</title>
		<author>no-reply@theyorker.co.uk (Gillian Love)</author>
		<link>http://www.theyorker.co.uk/comments/thread/12139</link>
		<description><![CDATA[I love the message of this piece - that to be a modern man is to be free, especially if you're privileged enough to be in the position to benefit from university etc.<br />
<br />
" We’re on an equal pedestal with women - despite what a few extremists may argue. "<br />
Hmm I won't slip into lecture mode here, but it is certainly not an extremist position to argue than women are not necessarily equal to men in all areas of our society (if we're focussing on the UK or the west; if we're going broader, women definitely aren't on an equal footing).<br />
<br />
I'd go as far as to say that it is partly thanks to feminism (the 'extremist' position you referred to) that it is possible to say "Man now has the most freedom he has ever had," since a great deal of feminist effort is spent unravelling rigid and unsatisfactory gender roles for men and women.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, a very interesting take on the modern man.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good piece, though it doesn't need to be said that some people at York in the student age group are very mature, and that "it is a trait of the modern man to blame other things, to blame other people, for his own failings" and therefore not impossible to deliberately and purposefully grow up :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[East Coast doesn't provide free wi-fi unless you're a first class customer.<br />
<br />
We actually have some of the cheapest rail fares in Europe as well as the most expensive because there is such a disparity in the price of tickets. You simply need to be savvy. <br />
<br />
But, the fares hit commuters most. Students don't really have anything to moan about compared to those travelling from home counties to London on a daily basis.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The problem is that the train companies have a monopoly on their respective routes, meaning that they can charge what they like and the public have to dig deeper into their pockets because they have no other choice. The train companies are out to make a profit, so the easiest way to do that is to drive up the prices, if the railways were nationalised then they would be on a not for profit basis, so there would be no need to charge so much.<br />
<br />
Having said that, East Coast has been nationalised and the service is just as crap and expensive as any other train service.]]></description>
