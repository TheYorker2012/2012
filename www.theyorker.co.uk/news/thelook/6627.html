				Do women hide too much behind their looks?			</div>
				<div class="Date">Tuesday, 1st March 2011</div>

		<div class="SubText">Written by Mirza Ahmed</div>

        <p><strong>There has been much talk and research into feminist ideas and the movement has had its good and bad points. However one area that hasn&rsquo;t been given sufficient attention is the issue of fashion and it is what I hope to write on in this article, hopefully giving food for further contemplation and debate.</strong></p>
<p>At university we are youth that are still having our intellectual powers shaped by experience, culture and the education system and within this trend we are expected to take part in the &ldquo;university scene&rdquo; where men and women try to constantly attract each other, taking all sorts of means in the pursuit so that we can fulfil our sensual desires.</p>
<p>My observation dictates that the dresses of women at university are more geared towards attracting men than the dresses of men being geared towards women and this represents a fundamental imbalance and injustice. Why is it that women must dress in ways to attract men but not vice versa? It is due to a patriarchal society and men constantly (whether explicitly or implicitly) wanting to force their ideals on women and we should counter this imbalance, hence moving towards a fairer society in all levels of existence.</p>
<p>I believe that clothing should not come in the way of any gender&rsquo;s right to be valued by their personality and characteristics, instead of looks. This means that clothing should not give specific attention to certain physical characteristics, and the more the clothing forces the other gender to look beyond physique and towards the intellectual capabilities and personality of the gender, the better the clothing. The reason that attraction to physical characteristics should be de-emphasised is that attributes like looks deteriorate over time and to base a relationship based on something that will deteriorate is a recipe for disaster and probably a major reason for the large number of break ups and divorces in the UK.</p>
<p>Now this does not mean that a person cannot dress beautifully or nicely, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be done to attract the opposite gender towards one&rsquo;s external characteristics. A beautiful Muslim saying comes to mind &ldquo;God is Beautiful and loves Beauty, so dress well for His sake&rdquo;. Now what if someone retorts that s/he wears revealing clothing not for the sake of the opposite gender, but because it looks nice? I would answer that such clothing will attract the opposite gender and one should be aware of signals that are sent out. Both genders are here for the long haul and should mutually cooperate.</p>
<p>The first treatment of any problem is acknowledgement, then solutions and finally their application. Thus the existence of this discrimination needs to be acknowledged, and it persists in many levels of society, through differences in clothing requirements of men and women in jobs to client dinners (the recommendation to women employees to seduce or attract the client is often done through subtle ways or even explicitly).</p>

<p>In defence of men, they do dress to impress women when they&#039;re out. Women try to impress men by wearing something a bit clevagey or leggy because we know lots of men will like that. Men go out in a decent shirt and jeans in the knowledge that most women will find that attractive. Would you rather that men would go out in speedos and a deep v t-shirt, showing off their assets, in the name of equality?.</p>
<p>Also, there&#039;s nothing wrong with attracting a potential partner with your looks, I don&#039;t know anyone who would actually base a relationship on that fact. In a club situation you are going to need to find them attractive to talk to them, then you&#039;ll learn more about the personality which is where the real stuff comes in. So what&#039;s wrong with me emphasising the ole G cups to better my chances of an initial chat?</p>
<p>You shouldn&#039;t judge a book by it&#039;s cover, but when it&#039;s on the shelf among a hundred others  if there&#039;s nothing you like on the cover, you&#039;ll probably never notice it enough to see what&#039;s inside.</p>

<p>I think the above comment is interesting in relation to Roxy&#039;s article &quot;How to get attention&quot; http://www.theyorker.co.uk/news/roxy/6266 .  Judging a book by its cover is the worst thing you can do, but yeah, if the cover is not bright and shiny then you&#039;re unlikely to notice it in the first place.</p>

<p>In Western culture we have a strong tradition and heritage of celebrating both the male and female forms.  In different ways, and with shifts across different eras, we find each other beautiful. Our culture has always celebrated and enjoyed the human form and in a myriad of ways, people still follow this tradition. Fashion, including its aspects that emphasise our human beauty, is a strong part of our cultural identity.</p>
<p>I disagree with you that men do not dress to look attractive to others.  Jeans, tshirts, shirts, suits often combine to accentuate height, muscle-tone, slimness and other attributes.</p>
<p>Fashion and the extent to what one wishes to accentuate, be it cleavage, thigh, height, six-pack, muscle etc etc perhaps modifies as we grow older, and revealing fashion is perhaps a preserve of youth.  But many people continue to want to look outwardly beautiful no matter their age.</p>
<p>I think it is rather naive to state that these outward appearances mask or dazzle our quest to seek friends, lovers and spouses who are kind, thoughtful, funny and enlivening inside.  Character is more important to most of us.  A woman will still be judged on her intellect and psychology, whether or not she looks great.</p>
<p>And who does and does not look great is not a set or defined thing anyway.  I think feminism has little to add here.  It&#039;s voice was rather thin in the era that feminism debated these issues.  It is my experience that a post-feminist rationale champions the rights of a woman to look and feel sexy as well as being a powerful, respect-worthy person.</p>
<p>Above all, a political argument is unlikely to overturn three thousand years&#039; worth of art, literature and thought.  The human body is beautiful.  Let both men and women enjoy and celebrate this.</p>

<p>It is an extremely faulty and simplistic appraisal of human nature that assumes that the outward appearance of a woman dictates everything we think about her.  We are all guilty to varying degrees of making some stereotypical snap judgements, sure.  But a complex society is a product of the complex thought of its individuals, and I think the vast majority of men and women see far deeper into each other&#039;s characters than the writer worries.  I would also add that anything that smacks of having to cover up, mask or hide the human form on the assumption that the male or female gaze is rapacious, morally faulty, trivially predatory, incapable of deeper discernment etc. is deeply offensive to our culture, which is where this strand of feminist thinking hit the buffers in the 1960s and 70s.</p>

<p>it concerns me how much single attributes are valued. Not just outward appearances but also things like intelligence. As a woman, I&#039;d quite like not to be judged for a start, but if you insist then a combination of my intelligence, social skills, looks and empathy amounts others would be nice. The thought of being judged only for my intelligence is just as unappealing and 2-d as judging only on my looks.<br />
I&#039;d like people to be considered as holistic individuals.</p>
<p>that being said, it&#039;s hard to convey that in Ziggy&#039;s....</p>

<p>Clearly you&#039;ve never walked around Newcastle city centre during the summer months. People should be encouraged to cover up more, imo - or at least wear clothes which fit them.</p>
<p>Having said that, I do think that girls slap on too much make-up. In my experience, many women look better without it anyway, and it can be counter-productive as you&#039;re always wondering what they *really* look under all that gunk.</p>

<p>By the way I didn&#039;t mean to say that feminist writers haven&#039;t advocated the view about women fashion, in fact many of them have (try a simple google search to see plenty) but its just not given much publicity because it goes against a male dominated society.<br />
Nor have I denied that men dress for the sake of women, I denied that its done to the same extent, and that is shown by the less body that is shown by men (and that&#039;s a thrust of my argument). Any disparity in the skin that each shows?</p>

<p>I am relieved that someone has finally decided to do an article on this, I was very tempted to write one myself. Firstly, let me start by saying if you are looking for a guy in Ziggys and attracting him based on looks and how little your wearing, this doesnt shout &#039;decent, trustworthy guy&#039; it shouts &#039;its ok for you to view women in this way&#039; and with that in mind, do you really think  they arent going to be be checking out all the other girls out too when you go back to the same club? Personally a nightclub is that LAST place I would look for a guy.</p>
<p>But back to the point, I agree that the way women dress is centered around attracting a guy, ive been guilty of it myself on occasion, but seriously women why? Why do we have to do it, if you have a pretty face, decent figure why should you feel the need to constantly dress up, look around campus, men dont do it, why should we. I know it makes you more confident ect but we shouldnt give in to this male ideology that is forced upon us, were better than that! Easier said than done, but if women say they do it for any other reason than attracting guys attention is clearly lying. When are you going to start realizing its actually quite degrading?</p>

<p>Oh, #11 i&#039;d love to know where you gained more knowledge about me than ... I do. I don&#039;t look nice around campus to attract men, i&#039;ve already it one. I look good out of self respect, i&#039;d hate to  be seen looking bad by anyone, it would be embarrassing. Everyone should try to look nice, and I judge both men and women who fail on that front.<br />
Why do feminists feel the need to impose their views on the rest of woman-kind, the ones of us happy to sit back in the knowledge that we&#039;re real women.</p>

<p>First off im not a feminist, but you can look good in a pair of old jeans and a casual tight top, dresses, short skirts and low tops therefore dont become a necessity. If you dont wear those things doesnt mean your going to look ugly, just self assured which conveys more confidence than trying so hard.</p>
<p>For example, I love wearing my usual baggy jeans and a tight top, or something relatively gothic, but when I do go out wearing a short skirt ect I know ill get more attention, but why? I still have the same face. I just see it as a shame that we women have to dress excessively &#039;girly&#039; or slightly &#039;sluty&#039; to make us feel better (as those things gain us male attention) but if the media and &#039;fashion&#039; didnt force it so much as &#039;this is female beauty nothing more nothing less&#039; I think wed all have a bit more confidence.</p>

<p>Are we at the same university? Where are these girls that parade around campus in low cut tops and skirts? I&#039;d like to meet these elusive creatures, all I see around campus is girls that do casual with enough effort to still look nice (mainly consisting of leggings not short skirts and clevage) and then girls that just don&#039;t bother.<br />
This mythical campus of beauties in clubwear sounds like a right laugh though, show me to it.</p>

<p>Surely a feminist would want to wear what they wanted without being judged by either sex and without any stigma attached to their personal choice?<br />
#11, how could you possibly know what goes through someone&#039;s head when they choose what to wear? Your comment is unfounded.</p>

<p>Goodness me. I suppose that if a man thinks I&#039;m a slut then I suppose I&#039;ll be forced to have sex with him because that identifies what I am. You, #16, are so judgemental that you are putting the feminist movement, society even, back to the dark ages. It is labels like slut (a term which, sadly, women call each other without a second thought) which make men think it&#039;s ok to treat women like objects, not a bit of clevage or a short skirt.<br />
Thank-you for your pity though, it really changed my perspective. I&#039;ll have to tell my boyfriend of 3 years that despite our relationship built on mutual respect and a meeting of minds, he lacks self respect for going out with such a hussy.</p>
