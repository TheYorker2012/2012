        <p><strong>14:38</strong> Test</p>
<p><strong>23:22</strong> Right, thanks to all that followed the action this evening! We hope you guys enjoyed the variety of ridiculata, and we&#039;ll be seeing you next year in Germany!</p>
<p><strong>23:21</strong> Congratulations to her and everything, but honestly, whiny voice!</p>
<p><strong>23:18</strong> It&#039;s kind of funny, the lyrics are meant to be representing annoyance, but she&#039;s so happy that it&#039;s not reflected at all in her singing!</p>
<p><strong>23:18</strong> This is so endearing. She looks like a rabbit caught in the headlights... except not about to die.</p>
<p><strong>23:17</strong> Right, the show&#039;s coming to a close and Lena&#039;s singing us out with the German flag on stage. She&#039;s purely beaming!</p>
<p><strong>23:16</strong> So, this time next year in Germany. Break out the beer and the bratwurst!</p>
<p><strong>23:15</strong> &#039;Do I have to sing now&#039; - Lena says with fear in the depths of her soul.</p>
<p><strong>23:14</strong> If Britain actually WANT to win we need to actually try. I recommend hiring Girls Aloud and the Xenomania team to write a song very similar to &#039;The Loving Kind&#039;, &#039;Call The Shots&#039; or &#039;Love Machine&#039;</p>
<p><strong>23:13</strong> Lots of sparkly lights, Lena&#039;s coming out with her troupe. Bless her, she&#039;s only 19, she&#039;s crying with happiness.</p>
<p><strong>23:11</strong> It&#039;s now official Germany have won. They are the first &#039;Big Four&#039; nation to win since Britain were victors in 1997. Also their first victory as a unified nation. Well done to Lena!</p>
<p><strong>23:11</strong> Final country&#039;s votes now (not that they matter anymore). Armenia - 8: Ukraine (&quot;I like her very much!&quot;) 10: Russia 12: Georgia (SHINE! SHINE!) And yes, the UK have come last.</p>
<p><strong>23:09</strong> Sweden calling (&#039;a swedish zac efron&#039; - Nat): 8 - Denmark, 10 - Romania, 12 - Germany</p>
<p><strong>23:09</strong> Georgia&#039;s rep looks like Lindsay Lohan. Anyway, results (3 to UK, putting us in double figures) - 8: Azerbaijan 10: Armenia 12: Belarus (for the record, the ones at the bottom, putting the UK in last place!)</p>
<p><strong>23:07</strong> Current standings:
1 - Germany 234
2 - Turkey 160
3 - Belgium 141</p>
<p><strong>23:07</strong> Moldova (where granny plays the drum): 8 - Ukraine, 10 - Russia, 12 - Romania</p>
<p><strong>23:06</strong> Macedonia - I think they&#039;re self pitying for not going through - 8: Germany 10: Turkey 12: Albania</p>
<p><strong>23:04</strong> Israel (he looks very solumn, like he has people buried in his basement): 8 - Romania, 10 - Russia, 12 - Armenia</p>
<p><strong>23:03</strong> Netherlands - gorgeous dress! - although she just fell in my eyes using the phrase &#039;X Factor&#039; - 8: Turkey 10: Israel 12: Armenia (I think she meant Dutch men were voting for Apricot lady&#039;s boobs)</p>
<p><strong>23:03</strong> I am loving the lack of traditional block-voting for many countries.</p>
<p><strong>23:02</strong> UK votes (holler): 8 - Romania, 10 - Turkey, 12 - Greece</p>
<p><strong>23:01</strong> Belgium - 8: Iceland 10: Germany (boo!) 12: Greece (whoop!)</p>
<p><strong>23:00</strong> Switzerland: 8 - Albania, 10 - Serbia, 12 - Germany</p>
<p><strong>23:00</strong> Belarus (he&#039;s barely blinking - those eyes will paralyse you!) - 8: Israel 10: Ukraine 12: Russia (lots of booing in response! Guess people don&#039;t like misery and depression. Who knew?)</p>
<p><strong>22:58</strong> Lithuania (quite cute for an older man): 8 - Spain, 10 - Germany, 12 - Georgia</p>
<p><strong>22:57</strong> Cyprus reporting from the exotic location of the Cyprus international airport - 8: Romania 10: Azerbaijan 12: Greece (yay!)</p>
<p><strong>22:56</strong> Now the votes from the home nation (and inside an echo chamber): 8 - Denmark, 10 - Romania, 12 - Germany</p>
<p><strong>22:55</strong> Malta (what a hideous curtain she&#039;s draped in!) - 8: Denmark 10: Belgium 12: Azerbaijan (not bad!)</p>
<p><strong>22:54</strong> After a brief hope of a turning tide Germany definately have it!</p>
<p><strong>22:54</strong> Hello from Latvia all dressed in Brown (stop talking and giving flowers, blech): 8 - Russia, 10 - Denmark, 12 - Germany</p>
<p><strong>22:53</strong> Ukraine&#039;s votes announcer looks a bit like a milkmaid. Anyway, down to votes (Germany only got 5). 8: Turkey 10: Russia 12: Azerbaijan. They&#039;re not doing too bad!</p>
<p><strong>22:51</strong> Bulgaria: 8 - Armenia, 10 - Turkey, 12 - Azerbaijan</p>
<p><strong>22:50</strong> Back to main results. Slovakia - 8: Israel 10: Belgium 12: Germany (this is looking more inevitable now)</p>
<p><strong>22:48</strong> We&#039;ve got 20/39 at the mo. Here&#039;s the results:
Germany 134
Turkey 96
Belgium 93
Denmark 84
Romania 82
Could anyone else take it from Germany at this stage?
The German singer has a really WHINY voice.</p>
<p><strong>22:46</strong> Spain!: 8 - Armenia, 10 - Romania, 12 - Germany</p>
<p><strong>22:45</strong> France up now - obviously has to speak in French and not English - 8: Portugal 10: Serbia(!) 12: Turkey!</p>
<p><strong>22:45</strong> How are Ireland and Iceland doing so badly tonight?</p>
<p><strong>22:44</strong> Denmark votes (not for themselves thankfully): 8 - Romania, 10 - Belgium, 12 - Germany</p>
<p><strong>22:43</strong> Top 5 currently looks like:
1 - Germany
2 - Denmark
3 - Belgium
4 - Turkey
5 - Greece</p>
<p><strong>22:43</strong> Iceland votes for: 8 - Greece, 10 - Belgium, 12 - Denmark</p>
<p><strong>22:41</strong> Greece up now - same guy who gave votes last year too! - 8: France 10: Albania 12: Cyprus (no surprise!)</p>
<p><strong>22:40</strong> Azerbaijan: 8 - Georgia, 10 - Ukraine, 12 - Turkey</p>
<p><strong>22:39</strong> If Germany win this it&#039;ll be their first victory for 28 years.</p>
<p><strong>22:39</strong> Portugal (14th to vote - Germany only 1 and Denmark 4) - 8: Greece 10: Romania 12: Spain</p>
<p><strong>22:38</strong> Russia: 8 - Azerbaijan, 10 - Georgia, 12 - Armenia (yay apricots)</p>
<p><strong>22:37</strong> You have to love the Estonian guy singing his results. What a legend!</p>
<p><strong>22:37</strong> Estonia: 8 - Georgia, 10 - Russia, 12 - Germany</p>
<p><strong>22:36</strong> One more Balkan country - come on Serbia and Bosnia!
Slovenia (only 4 points to Bosnia): 8 - Serbia (told ya!) 10 - Germany 12 - Denmark</p>
<p><strong>22:35</strong> Finland: 8 - France, 10 - Israel, 12 - Germany (we could have a winner here)</p>
<p><strong>22:34</strong> No national adjudicators are going to block Balkan voting!</p>
<p><strong>22:34</strong> Bosnia calling, here are their votes with scary eyeliner: 8 - Germany, 10 - Turkey, 12 - Serbia</p>
<p><strong>22:33</strong> Poland (from the Polish people if there was any doubt) 8: Azerbaijan 10: Belgium 12: Denmark</p>
<p><strong>22:32</strong> Smile and no one will suspect that the telephone isn&#039;t working</p>
<p><strong>22:32</strong> More of some lovely Balkan block voting!</p>
<p><strong>22:32</strong> Croatia: 8 - Serbia, 10 - Bosnia, 12 - Turkey</p>
<p><strong>22:31</strong> Current top 3 stands at Greece, Germany &amp; Belgium</p>
<p><strong>22:31</strong> No votes from Turkey to Cyprus, how unusual</p>
<p><strong>22:31</strong> Let&#039;s talk Turkey: 8 - Bosnia, 10 - Germany, 12 - Azerbaijan</p>
<p><strong>22:30</strong> Albania (1 point for UK!) - 8: Turkey 10: Germany 12: Greece!</p>
<p><strong>22:30</strong> COME ON GREECE!!!</p>
<p><strong>22:29</strong> YES! BALKAN BLOCK VOTING!</p>
<p><strong>22:29</strong> Serbia&#039;s vote: 8 - Germany, 10 - Greece, 12 - Bosnia</p>
<p><strong>22:28</strong> Germany (why is the public singing seven nation army?) - 8: Greece 10: Turkey 12: Belgium</p>
<p><strong>22:27</strong> Denmark!? Seriously!?</p>
<p><strong>22:27</strong> Ireland gave UK 4. Well at least that song of crap won&#039;t get nul points.</p>
<p><strong>22:26</strong> Ireland voted: 8 - Germany, 10 - Belgium, 12 - Denmark</p>
<p><strong>22:26</strong> 8 - Turkey. 10 - Moldova (neighbours, duh). 12 - Denmark (the &#039;wanna know&#039; people)</p>
<p><strong>22:25</strong> Romania are the first to vote. Commence ass-kissing.</p>
<p><strong>22:24</strong> Oh, here we go. &quot;We have been dancing here, it has been so fun&quot;. Couldn&#039;t have been more deadpan if he tried.</p>
<p><strong>22:23</strong> Finally, we&#039;ve got results coming up. Oh, but no, we must first say hello to the exec supervisor of Eurovision. But bear in mind, it&#039;s not actually real.</p>
<p><strong>22:21</strong> GAH IT&#039;S THE CLOWNS!</p>
<p><strong>22:20</strong> Call me crazy, but I&#039;m loving this. It&#039;s so all inclusive. Definitely makes it feel like the whole of Europe is uniting.</p>
<p><strong>22:19</strong> Loving the loner dancing in the North Sea.</p>
<p><strong>22:18</strong> The dancing webcam footage is priceless. Some brilliant moments of dancing dogs, bouncing children and generally people looking like tools. THIS is what Eurovision is all about!</p>
<p><strong>22:17</strong> Extreme goosebump moment here! An entertaining interval act. How did Norway do this!</p>
<p><strong>22:15</strong> we had to be the least co-ordinated country in Europe *hangs head in shame*</p>
<p><strong>22:15</strong> It&#039;s actually sort of awesome - we&#039;ve got massive crowds of people doing the same dance routine all over European streets.</p>
<p><strong>22:14</strong> Those suits are terrible. They&#039;re doing a flashmob inspired thing where more and more people are joining in. It&#039;s sort of like in a musical...</p>
<p><strong>22:14</strong> Overenthusiastic bouncers there... hehe</p>
<p><strong>22:12</strong> Time for the infamous interval act. Norwegian urban dance music.</p>
<p><strong>22:12</strong> On a mere fraction of the budget that Russia had last year Norway have a lot to be proud of.</p>
<p><strong>22:11</strong> Counting down until the lines are closed. DRAMATIC.</p>
<p><strong>22:09</strong> I&#039;ll take this opportunity to tell you all to youtube Slovenia&#039;s entry which didn&#039;t make it past the semifinals but was AMAZING.</p>
<p><strong>22:06</strong> Yet anothe recap of songs. And a FOURTH chance to hear that damned Spanish song!</p>
<p><strong>22:05</strong> There are nuts in the applecake. Notify the coastguard!!!</p>
<p><strong>22:03</strong> We&#039;re just recapping at the mo. On second watching, we&#039;ve noticed the misfortunate eyebrow shaping of Ukraine and the fact that Portugal looks like Amelle Berrabah on a bad day.</p>
<p><strong>22:01</strong> Peter - &#039;Ok I may be voting for both Iceland and Armenia&#039;</p>
<p><strong>21:58</strong> Peter - &#039;I am voting for Armenia. Satanic apricot rituals for the win&#039;</p>
<p><strong>21:58</strong> Is anyone voting? Let yourselves be heard!</p>
<p><strong>21:56</strong> We got pizza offers from the host, a microwave and he just unveiled a lime green sparkly shirt. This has just become farcical.</p>
<p><strong>21:56</strong> &#039;if you have several favourites vote for all of them&#039; - please contact the billpayer before you do this</p>
<p><strong>21:54</strong> And the backing singer comes on with the old slip n&#039; slide. Very dramatic and VERY unnecessary.</p>
<p><strong>21:53</strong> Why oh why did they have to perform this again. It is the stuff of childhood nightmares... &quot;Can&#039;t sleep, clowns will eat me&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>21:52</strong> We&#039;re being treated to creepy circus and Leo Sayer again, for those of you who forgot.</p>
<p><strong>21:51</strong> Well, that would be the end, if we weren&#039;t being tied down and forced to listen to Spain again. Gah.</p>
<p><strong>21:50</strong> A first for the evening. The singers are approaching the crowd. Ceremoniously accompanied by a key change.</p>
<p><strong>21:49</strong> Oh no they&#039;re being pulled apart! Such star crossed lovers!</p>
<p><strong>21:49</strong> A rather comic screen separating them on stage. A grating chorus of the words &quot;wanna know&quot; repeated 12 times.</p>
<p><strong>21:48</strong> No Danish people were involved in the making of this song apparently. Written by Swedes and performed by Thai and Russian peoples.</p>
<p><strong>21:47</strong> He&#039;s definitely getting swept up in his own song. He looks like he&#039;s about to cry with blind passion. He does keep repeating &#039;Lord!&#039; in Hebrew.</p>
<p><strong>21:45</strong> Aw, he&#039;s so pretty! I could melt into those brown eyes.</p>
<p><strong>21:44</strong> Get ready ladies and gentlemen. It&#039;s sounds like he&#039;ll break into a chorus of &#039;All By Myself&#039;/</p>
<p><strong>21:44</strong> Israel now - he was a runner-up on their Israeli Idol. Thankfully, singing in his native language, something many haven&#039;t done.</p>
<p><strong>21:43</strong> Aaah...assault on ears....assault!!!</p>
<p><strong>21:42</strong> Her mouth... it&#039;s like a cave.</p>
<p><strong>21:41</strong> On a good note. At least the dress is pretty. Right?</p>
<p><strong>21:41</strong> Well, we&#039;ve already had pitch problems from her trying to imitate Leona Lewis. We&#039;re dreading those inevitable big notes...</p>
<p><strong>21:40</strong> Now Portugal - entered 43 times and never won, or even been top 5. I&#039;ll be honest, this year won&#039;t be different. She&#039;s a London student.</p>
<p><strong>21:38</strong> &#039;I painted my toenails for you just to feel the dye&#039; - this girl needs to get out more.</p>
<p><strong>21:37</strong> Cute as a button and singing in a slight yodel. She may be slightly scary but am strangely drawn to her like a siren from Greek mythology.</p>
<p><strong>21:37</strong> Germany on now. A bit of a gothic Amy Adams singing. Wearing a cute LBD, but why sing in English with the beautiful poetic German language...?</p>
<p><strong>21:35</strong> THE RITUAL WORKED! A TREE GREW ON STAGE!!! Looks like the backing dancer did not die in vain. You didn&#039;t see that? That&#039;s because of the mirrors.</p>
<p><strong>21:34</strong> It does have the oldest performer ever (83) for Eurovision playing the dukduk. At least that partly redeems this song.</p>
<p><strong>21:34</strong> Taking all bets... which one will be the blood sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>21:33</strong> Ok, backing dancers drinking wine. Here is hoping for some satanic apricot-based ritual.</p>
<p><strong>21:33</strong> Well, smart move to get the boobs out. Not sure how many votes an apricot is going to mobilise.</p>
<p><strong>21:32</strong> Armenia with &#039;Apricot Stone&#039;. It is actually a song about apricots. Seriously. There is a giant apricot stone on stage. It is HILARIOUS.</p>
<p><strong>21:31</strong> Only 5 left... and Spain. Damn you stage invader!!!</p>
<p><strong>21:31</strong> Well, good to know the Uk table in the Green Room has a beefeater. And a mini-volcano at the Iceland table - LOL!</p>
<p><strong>21:30</strong> This would have been better if given the option to compare meerkats.</p>
<p><strong>21:29</strong> &quot;And I&#039;m looking at your photo&quot;. Fortunately we got a shot of the photo. It is most likely a child&#039;s scribble of a Da Vinci painting.</p>
<p><strong>21:28</strong> &#039;Here I am lost and forgotten&#039;... soon he&#039;ll whip out the razorblades and we&#039;ll be all the more thankful.</p>
<p><strong>21:27</strong> Russia - apparently they got booed when they got through the semi-finals. &#039;Lost and Forgotten&#039;. Rated &#039;D&#039; for &#039;Depresso-Rama&#039;.</p>
<p><strong>21:26</strong> Could her outfit be any tighter? A wrong move and there will be the sound of ripping.</p>
<p><strong>21:26</strong> I&#039;m just waiting for actual fire-playing. The piano did just shoot fire though. But that might have been a reaction to her wailing which only the dogs could hear.</p>
<p><strong>21:25</strong> The lights in the background are randomly spelling out &#039;girl&#039; and &#039;boy&#039;. There has been a severe lack of pyrotechnics in this song.</p>
<p><strong>21:24</strong> Onto Romania - &#039;Playing with Fire&#039;. The singer apparently lives and works in Norway. Opening few bars a little &#039;Don&#039;t Stop Believin&#039; esque. Nope, forget that. We have duelling pianos on a perspex piano. And whoa, the female singer&#039;s face looks like it&#039;s made of plastic.</p>
<p><strong>21:21</strong> &quot;Clap your hands!&quot; We oblige, and then stop realising how dumb we look.</p>
<p><strong>21:21</strong> Oh my! Cheeky bum slap - Nat</p>
<p><strong>21:20</strong> A bit of cheeky grinding from the lead singers. Some Latino-Caribbean influence going on too.</p>
<p><strong>21:19</strong> Suddenly we are well and truly put of Balladtown and into danceville. About time too. This is getting fun :D</p>
<p><strong>21:19</strong> Now onto a cheesy europop entry from France: &#039;Allez, Olla, Ole!&quot; Their official world cup record too.</p>
<p><strong>21:18</strong> This dress is what we like to call a &#039;naked dress&#039;. Fully clothed yet looks like she is in the nuddy.</p>
<p><strong>21:17</strong> It&#039;s all kinds of dramatic. Peter: &quot;I feel kind of bad for her...but I kind of want her to stop&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>21:16</strong> Ukraine now (number 17, if you&#039;re keeping count); she&#039;s in a red dress with a black cloak over her head :S Singing a song called &#039;Sweet People&#039;, I think it&#039;s supposed to have some sort of message. &quot;Sweet People, what have we done?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>21:15</strong> This is the song that Iceland have tried for a few years to win Eurovision with. This is definately their strongest entry since Birgitta sang &#039;Open Your Heart&#039; in 2003</p>
<p><strong>21:13</strong> Immediate love! It&#039;s catchy, great beat, good vocals and in a pseudo-block voting country. There has to be decent odds on this doing exceptionally well.</p>
<p><strong>21:12</strong> Iceland on now. A big jolly redhaired lady in a big red dress. Song called &#039;Je Ne Sais Quoi&#039;. Though don&#039;t be fooled, she&#039;s still singing in English. Apparently it&#039;s a big clubbing anthem over there.</p>
<p><strong>21:10</strong> So far none of these songs are pop that we could imagine Girls Aloud singing. Ergo: no clear winner as of yet.</p>
<p><strong>21:09</strong> Disappointing chorus. Started out edgy with elements of electronica and descended into mindless cheese. Love the mad violinist :)</p>
<p><strong>21:08</strong> Albania up next. Her violinist recently performed for the Pope. Titled &#039;It&#039;s All About You&#039;. First impressions: very Goldfrapp.</p>
<p><strong>21:06</strong> Robot costume = aluminium power ranger! She&#039;s also cutting her metallic wrists with a chainsaw. How emo!</p>
<p><strong>21:05</strong> The style of camerawork has drastically changed to suit the band. I&#039;m liking the darkness of it, the colour matches my soul.</p>
<p><strong>21:04</strong> Verging a little on heavy-metal/electronica. They&#039;re all dressed pretty emo.</p>
<p><strong>21:03</strong> Turkey time. Very nervous smile from the lead singer. Quite a good pedigree in their history. Interesting... a woman dressed as a robot!</p>
<p><strong>21:02</strong> Aw, dude. She did not handle that key change well. She is just YELLING.</p>
<p><strong>21:02</strong> The dancers are varying between carrying the singer around, rolling on the floor and exchanging loving glances. There has to be some form of etiquette.</p>
<p><strong>21:02</strong> Singer&#039;s interacting a lot with her dancers. It&#039;s quite a nice simple melody, although she doesn&#039;t quite pull off that money note.</p>
<p><strong>21:00</strong> Next up, Georgia. Peforming true to their flag colours in red and white.</p>
<p><strong>20:59</strong> &quot;I lied like a rug&quot; - Oh Graham you&#039;re doing so well tonight. Love you!</p>
<p><strong>20:58</strong> Time for the commercial break... time for a scripted moment with Graham Norton.</p>
<p><strong>20:58</strong> &#039;DO NOT CALL FOR THE UK&#039; it said at the bottom. It&#039;s because we can&#039;t, but still, it&#039;s pretty sage advice.</p>
<p><strong>20:57</strong> We appear to be in the vicinity of homely Essex style backing dancers... could we not have tried a smidgen harder?</p>
<p><strong>20:57</strong> &#039;You bring the sunshine, I&#039;ll bring the good times&#039;. Yikes. Also rhyming &#039;laughter&#039; with &#039;Happy ever after&#039;. Ugh.</p>
<p><strong>20:55</strong> Pete Waterman has publically disowned this track, which has now turned into a Rick Astley B-Side. I feel so bad for the singer, he has been truly diddled.</p>
<p><strong>20:54</strong> Now we have the underwhelming pathetic UK entry. Josh Dubovie singing the Pete Waterman-penned &#039;That Sounds Good to Me&#039;. It&#039;s a bit like that One True Voice track from a few years back.</p>
<p><strong>20:53</strong> I think we have a favourite with OPA. It&#039;s catchy, it&#039;s gimmicky and there&#039;s large drums. What&#039;s there not to love?</p>
<p><strong>20:52</strong> Aw, the rhythm is so infectious! They&#039;re all dressed in white. Then again, Greece have gone into recession and probably can&#039;t afford to host the contest, so this won&#039;t be their A-game. Still, we declare it AWESOME.</p>
<p><strong>20:50</strong> It&#039;s Greecey time. Apparently this entry is jokes.</p>
<p><strong>20:49</strong> And out comes the wind machine for the key change!</p>
<p><strong>20:49</strong> Apparently the girl playing the flute is the singer&#039;s niece. Not a bad job, pretending to play a flute and get to be watched by hundreds of millions.</p>
<p><strong>20:47</strong> Ireland now. Singer same winner for Ireland as in 1993. Yet another ballad. She certainly sounds quite a bit like Bette Midler. But good choice of purple dress to go with bright red hair!</p>
<p><strong>20:45</strong> Out come the wings with the key change!</p>
<p><strong>20:44</strong> This song has more than a passing resemblance to &#039;Guy Love&#039; from that musical episode from Scrubs!</p>
<p><strong>20:43</strong> We&#039;ve got &#039;Butterflies&#039; from Belarus. And yes, they will quite literally be dressed as butterflies.</p>
<p><strong>20:41</strong> Spain are performing again because of the hatman! That&#039;s so stupid! Didn&#039;t make the performance anymore creepy!</p>
<p><strong>20:40</strong> Maybe it&#039;s his repeating the line &quot;This is the Balkans! This is the Balkans, Balkans, Balkans!&quot; Appeal to the patriots.</p>
<p><strong>20:40</strong> Out come the girls waving cleavage to get the straight guys interested... i don&#039;t know if that tactic suits the song</p>
<p><strong>20:39</strong> I&#039;ll be honest; I don&#039;t know how someone so camp got through in Serbia. It&#039;s not the most open-minded place...</p>
<p><strong>20:38</strong> Well, he mentions the town I was born in in the lyrics. I should love it...</p>
<p><strong>20:38</strong> Peter: Kill me now! Kill me now! Kill me now!</p>
<p><strong>20:37</strong> The singer looks a little like Bruno. He&#039;s outrageously camp. And here come the ridiculous Balkan horns!</p>
<p><strong>20:37</strong> Woo, here comes Nat&#039;s homeland! Representin&#039;.</p>
<p><strong>20:36</strong> Graham Norton declared it &#039;refreshing simplicity&#039;. Yup.</p>
<p><strong>20:36</strong> Lots of lovely falsetto...not always successful, but nevertheless, he&#039;s won over our hearts.</p>
<p><strong>20:35</strong> With the exception of Dima Bilan back in 2008 it is almost unheard of for a male sung ballad to win the contest... sorry Belgium. Can&#039;t argue with stats.</p>
<p><strong>20:33</strong> We&#039;re onto Belgium; a gorgeous guy singing acoustic &#039;Me and My Guitar&#039;. Lots of eye candy tonight!</p>
<p><strong>20:32</strong> Ooo, a dog celebrating at home! CUTE.</p>
<p><strong>20:31</strong> We had a nice little electric guitar solo (which he wasn&#039;t actually playing; apparently you just sing along to pre-recorded tracks!)</p>
<p><strong>20:30</strong> THUNDER AND LIGHTNING! from Bosnia. I wish they were singing in their own language...boo. Lots of strobe, very rocky as well.</p>
<p><strong>20:29</strong> That was quite nice and organic. Very un-Eurovision actually.</p>
<p><strong>20:27</strong> Not the first time they&#039;ve imported someone from the UK - in 2004 we had Lisa Andreas singing &#039;Stronger Every Minute&#039;. She was from Croydon.</p>
<p><strong>20:26</strong> Next up, Cyprus. &#039;Life looks better in spring&#039;. The singer&#039;s apparently from Wales though, even though the songwriters were Cypriot.</p>
<p><strong>20:24</strong> We have interesting fashion choices from the lead singer - inspiration from Drew Barrymore&#039;s sea urchin dress, and some Lady Gaga dress. Plus, a band of blue eye make-up around half her face.</p>
<p><strong>20:23</strong> Camp thrusts from a saxophonist. Love it!</p>
<p><strong>20:22</strong> Neon Violin FTW!</p>
<p><strong>20:22</strong> It&#039;s called &#039;Run Away&#039; and is by the Sunstroke Project.</p>
<p><strong>20:21</strong> Moldova next. Let&#039;s hope for another granny playing the drum!</p>
<p><strong>20:21</strong> OUCH! Don&#039;t try the long notes please! I think he blew out the speakers on the TV. Yikes!</p>
<p><strong>20:20</strong> This is pretty painful. You can tell Norway don&#039;t want to host again.</p>
<p><strong>20:18</strong> A cappella start, a little bit of piano. He can&#039;t sing *that* well, but he sure is pretty.</p>
<p><strong>20:18</strong> OK, onto the host country Norway. Plain title: &#039;My Heart is Yours&#039;.</p>
<p><strong>20:17</strong> This is very much resembling an episode of Extreme Ghostbusters from 10 years ago... this is frickin scary!</p>
<p><strong>20:16</strong> He actually did a pretty good job of looking like he fit in. But now we have another guy who ran on stage, and he apparently is supposed to belong!</p>
<p><strong>20:16</strong> Random guy managed to run onto the stage in a fez!!! God bless the bouncers.</p>
<p><strong>20:15</strong> This is why automatic qualification for the Big Four doesn&#039;t work... Spain hasn&#039;t tried since 2003</p>
<p><strong>20:15</strong> Ok, so he looks a little like Leo Sayer. And the background and music itself is very circus inspired. Ooo, acrobatics!</p>
<p><strong>20:14</strong> Rather laughably entitled &#039;Something Tiny&#039;.</p>
<p><strong>20:14</strong> Right, onto number 2 Spain. We have a dude in an afro and silver suit.</p>
<p><strong>20:13</strong> For a favourite, it&#039;s a little dull. But Peter&#039;s theory is that they modelled it on Molitva (winner three years ago) and made it a little more creative.</p>
<p><strong>20:12</strong> Also... how can one smell of lipstick Ms. Azerbaijan?</p>
<p><strong>20:12</strong> If this wins the names of the winners of Junior and regular eurovision will read &#039;Click Clack&#039; &#039;Drip Drop&#039;</p>
<p><strong>20:11</strong> It&#039;s called &#039;Drip Drop&#039;. They&#039;re singing in English. She&#039;s wearing a sparkly blue glove on her left hand, and a very oceanic (blue/green) dress. Also, she just walked down steps that light up!</p>
<p><strong>20:10</strong> Azerbaijan is going first...it&#039;s apparently the favourite as well. Pfft, no wonder since it&#039;s going first - more time to vote for them!</p>
<p><strong>20:08</strong> A difference this year is that lines are open from the start of the show. Surely that&#039;s unfair on the countries going last...?</p>
<p><strong>20:07</strong> oooo three presenters... makes for a threeway when they all eventually fall in love. Oh my, this is getting all too steamy.</p>
<p><strong>20:06</strong> Wow, I&#039;ve never noticed how much he looks like <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>&#039;s music editor Rich Powell...seriously. Separated at birth!</p>
<p><strong>20:05</strong> We have &#039;Fairytale&#039; prettyboy winner from last year doing his winning performance from last year.</p>
<p><strong>20:04</strong> Oh lord. People from different countries sending messages to their entrants encouraging them to win... blech</p>
<p><strong>20:02</strong> Currently we&#039;re zooming through history and hearing (the more successful) winners - lots of floating text of cities and years.</p>
<p><strong>20:01</strong> Apparently, 120 million people are watching Eurovision! Wow. Craziness.</p>
<p><strong>20:00</strong> Awwwww let&#039;s hope the hosts fall in love... as they do every year</p>
<p><strong>20:00</strong> Yay, Eurovision anthem!</p>
<p><strong>19:50</strong> For those of you who followed our Oscar liveblog, you&#039;ll be happy to know the Mexican five-layer dip is back :D</p>
<p><strong>19:50</strong> Good evening fellow Eurovision fans/watchers/first timers! We - Peter and Nat - are here with you for the rest of the evening, hoping to bring you some Eurovision banter, and some disturbingly high levels of Eurovision knowledge between us.</p>
