		<div class="SubText">My memories of this time last year are vague.  I&#039;m not saying they&#039;re lost in a vodka-filled haze, but they&#039;re shadowed by the awesome summer term that followed.  Looking back in the yorker office, I came across an unpublished blog that I&#039;d started writing for around this time last year - and thought it&#039;d be interesting to see how it compares to this term.</div>

        <p><em>Damn.  I don&rsquo;t think I can get away with yet another week of doing absolutely no work.  My essay deadline looms next week and I&rsquo;m beginning to realise that despite doing the reading for my seminars in the loosest sense of the word, most of the time I have little idea what&rsquo;s actually going on in them.  I see people with their mouths moving, so I assume they&rsquo;re talking &ndash; but about what, I have only a vague idea, based usually - but not always - on the book I have in my hand at the time.</em></p>
<p>I&#039;m going to be honest, I have a bit more of an idea what&#039;s going on in my course this year.  In fact, I&#039;m doing better than ever in my degree (reassuringly).  This week I even started my seminar reading on Monday - for a Friday seminar.  Now if that&#039;s not keen, I don&#039;t know what is.</p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m even writing this in a lecture, believe it or not: a 9.15 that I&rsquo;m beginning to wish I hadn&rsquo;t gotten up for.  Biology lecture theatres aren&rsquo;t the most comfortable places in which to try and concentrate first thing in the morning.  Last term I went to all of my lectures religiously, 9.15 or not.  Now I&rsquo;m thinking I may start being a bit more selective &ndash; not sure if it&rsquo;s a good habit to get into, but never mind.</em></p>
<p>I still have lectures in Biology; they&#039;re still uncomfortable, but that thank the gods I don&#039;t have any 9.15s.  I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d be able to cope if I did.  Lately, however much sleep I get it never seems to be enough.  With regard to being selective, I have started doing that.  If I&#039;m not studying a text, I might skip the lecture - but only if I have better things to be doing - like working on an essay.  Or, okay, I&#039;ll admit it, going shopping (one time only, I swear!).</p>
<p><em>My seminars are also struggling to live up to last term&rsquo;s awesomeness.  It&rsquo;s not that my new group is bad &ndash; in fact my tutor&rsquo;s really good &ndash; it&rsquo;s just that I don&rsquo;t know these people and it&rsquo;s an awful amount of effort to get to know them.  It&rsquo;s different from last term &ndash; as freshers, everyone is keen to get to know everyone and anyone else as soon as they meet them.  Now, people have settled into their little groups of friends, and it&rsquo;s becoming difficult &ndash; and people are less inclined &ndash; to branch out of those comfortable groups to make new ones.  I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll get there eventually, but Uni has become less of the &ldquo;land of opportunity&rdquo; I had felt it to be last term.</em></p>
<p>Well that&#039;s just depressing.  I think I&#039;ve stopped expecting the world of my seminars, and they have obliged by offering me a little slice of it each week instead.</p>
<p><em>But what has really caused these worries and doubts?  Well, apart from the need to adjust to work again after the relaxing holiday and empty first week, last week one of my best friends here decided to drop out of Uni.  It was a quick decision: the course wasn&rsquo;t right for her and she was gone before the week was out, leaving us reeling in the aftershock.  It left me especially doubtful of whether my course was right for me, and despite coming to the conclusion that (whether especially right or not) it was probably the &ldquo;most right&rdquo; for me, I was still unsettled.</em></p>
<p><em>Another friend, who stayed at home to retake his a levels, also triggered a &ldquo;what am I doing at University moment??&rdquo;  He has such conviction that he doesn&rsquo;t want to waste his life.  Attempting to enter Drama School, if he fails, he has determined to take off round the world working as he likes, even if it means he&rsquo;ll never be rich.  He doesn&rsquo;t want to destroy himself in the boredom of an office job and I don&rsquo;t want to either &ndash; yet he seems to possess the determination and courage that I lack.  While I build up my student debt and put off entering the real world, he&rsquo;s planning to do what I always wanted to.</em></p>
<p>I know I&#039;m doing the right course.  Yesterday I had the most amazing lecture. I only listened to about half of it, but that wasn&#039;t the point.  What was the point was that I wasn&#039;t listening because I was so busy writing.  So busy being inspired by what my lecturer was saying.  As long as I can still get that enthusiastic about lectures, I know I&#039;m on the right track.  So I want to be a writer; well, I think my degree here will give me the knowledge I need to be a good one - as I concluded this time last year:</p>
<p><em>But &ndash; thinking more on it, I have to admit one thing: despite these doubts and fears and worries, I am having one hell of a time at Uni.  I am enjoying my societies and my course (and ignoring the debt).  As well as this, my dreams of becoming a writer are probably best served by the work I do here, so I shall not be leaving anytime soon.</em></p>
<p>So it seems as though some things have changed drastically since last year, but there&#039;s still a sense of repetition - only this time it&#039;s not me. Each week there seems to be some sort of breakdown going on from amongst my circle.  It seems as though the stress of work, the stress of relationships - even the stress of friendships reach boiling point in this crucial, halfway-through-the-year stage.</p>
<p>But by looking back at this old blog, I&#039;ve at least realised that I&#039;m in a much better place than I was last year.  So maybe I&#039;m that much better equipped to deal with whoever it is that gets the spring-term blues this year.</p>

<p>Fabulous.  More inconsequential navel-gazing.  I&#039;m sick of these &#039;My thoughts about an aspect of my life&#039; pieces.  Sorry, but the likely audience for this kind of thing is going to be bloody small!  Why not pick something external to your experience that you and others might find absorbing or enlivening to write/read.</p>

<ul id="CommentItem10700History" class="comment_edit"><li>Wed, 23rd Feb 2011 12:00am - Edited by the author</li></ul><p>it&#039;s interesting that hardly anyone ever seems to comment on an article saying it&#039;s good - so how can these writer&#039;s know what to emulate?/what people want to read?</p>
<p>For my part, I&#039;m not really sure what I&#039;d like to read in a blog - surely the whole definition is that it is personal? Sometimes I just like a bit of mindless reading - like those trashy magazines I guess that are so rubbish but so addictive - but if I want to read something &quot;enlivening&quot;, I usually pick one of the comment-y pieces that I know is going to be something I can relate to/am interested in.  The whole concept of blogs seems fairly difficult to deal with IMO.</p>
<p>I think there should be more comment pieces on <span class="theyorker">the yorker</span> - but at the same time, I&#039;m not going to flame these guys for trying.</p>

<p>I think a good blogger needs to be able to offer a unique/unusual perspective on life, or have a specific persona, so that people can relate to it but also learn something (Girl From Malaysia, for example). I feel TGFD is lacking in all those (I was a fan last year) because it&#039;s stopped being about a fresher at uni, and has just become some 19-20 year old&#039;s published diary. I feel like these are written without considering what anyone else can get from them.</p>

<p>I have no problem with highly personalised blogging.  If, in its personalisation or individualism, it offers something fresh and unique.  But there are far too many pieces on <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> along the lines of:  &#039;I am a 19 year old girl&#039; and &#039;Why I can&#039;t decide whether it is great or sad being single&#039; and so on.  Sure...be self-absorbed, why not...many great writers are.  But be self-absorbed about an aspect of yourself that is a little bit more interesting?</p>

<p>#7 but isn&#039;t it the case that a lot of 19 year old girls dont know whether its good or bad to be single?</p>
