		</div>
		<div class="SubText">&quot;In the beginning the Universe was created.
This has made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move&quot;.
</div>

        <p><em>So Douglas Adams explained the state of things in his book, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. Okay, so maybe you&rsquo;re not seeing where I&rsquo;m going with this.  Well, I&rsquo;ll be honest, there have been times at university when I&rsquo;ve thought: okay, so making the universe was a bad move: but second only to this was my coming to uni.  In a two-part blog, I&rsquo;m going to give you my top ten reasons why&hellip;</em></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Okay, so, it&rsquo;s Freshers&rsquo; Week.  You don&rsquo;t really know anyone.  What&rsquo;s the most logical thing to do?</p>
<p>Ah, yes.  Cut the end off your thumb, of course!  Why didn&rsquo;t I do that?</p>
<p>Oh, yes.  That&rsquo;s right.  I did.</p>
<p>Yes, this was one of my first, &ldquo;I really shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to live on my own&rdquo; moments.  Possibly the first time at uni that it really sank in that I couldn&rsquo;t just go home and have my parents make everything better.  I was cooking, feeling all independent and everything, and what do I do?  Just go and chop the end off my thumb, leaving a bit behind on the chopping board and making an excellent first impression on my horrified flatmates.</p>
<p>Yes.  Wasn&rsquo;t my finest moment.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Next?  Well, it has to be the whole meeting new people thing.  Not that meeting new people is bad &ndash; in fact, the complete opposite &ndash; except when these people are trying too hard to be someone they&rsquo;re not.  Whether it&rsquo;s to fit in or to stand out, this has highly annoyed me.  There have been a few people I&rsquo;ve met, who I&rsquo;ve often wanted to slap, and shout, &ldquo;stop being ridiculous and hypocritical &ndash; this isn&rsquo;t you!&rdquo; at.  But, not only do these people try to be somebody else, but they end up blaming you for their faults when they find it difficult to keep their act up.</p>
<p>Not many, mind.  But enough.  And when some of them are blockmates, life can get rather awkward.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Third on the list has got to be course related.  Annoying seminar times to say the least.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be incredibly clich&eacute; here, but I hate 9.15s.  There was a time, when I could have easily made these everyday.  But it seems now, however much sleep I get, I always feel the compulsion to fall asleep if I have to concentrate at 9.15 in the morning.  It seems more than simply a year or so ago when such times were normal.</p>
<p>I also hate 5.15s.  By 2pm I&rsquo;m ready to switch off for the day &ndash; therefore a lecture or seminar this late is never going to have my full attention.  Thinking about what to cook for dinner.  Whether to stay in or go out.</p>
<p>It is never a good time.</p>
<p>Also, in winter: being in a class when it&rsquo;s dark outside?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather not.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Another general problem &ndash; this time: adjusting to the &ldquo;student lifestyle&rdquo;.</p>
<p>All through my sixth form years, one of the things that kept me working so hard was the promise of this amazing &ldquo;student lifestyle&rdquo; of late nights and lie-ins.  Of being able to eat what you want, when you want.  Of being free.</p>
<p>I soon discovered that while every cloud has a silver-lining, every silver-lining has a cloud.  And some are greyer than others.</p>
<p>First off, we aren&rsquo;t free &ndash; we have classes to attend and books to read and essays to write that we can&rsquo;t just ignore.  Secondly, attending said classes becomes very, very difficult when only 4 or 5 hours of sleep has been had the night before.  Or morning before, as is far more often the case.</p>
<p>And eating whatever you want, when you want, can soon become a bit dull. Having to cook everything for myself soon became tiresome after a stressful day: as I said before, we can&rsquo;t live on ice cream forever, and the same applies to chocolate Weetabix (damn Costcutters&rsquo; recent offer!) and broken biscuits.</p>
<p>I also never paid much attention to what I ate before, but the lack of fruit and fresh meals does catch up with you.  There have been weeks when I&rsquo;ve been tired all the time.  And getting ill is a far commoner occurrence than it ever was at home.  As a result, my sleeping pattern has disappeared, and sleeping in shifts of a couple of hours at a time throughout the day (basically whenever I can) has become the norm this term.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> The fifth issue on my list has definitely got to be the times when looking after a drunk friend, or even acquaintance, has been necessary.</p>
<p>The average person, when seeing someone in a state of extreme inebriation, will step in to offer a helping hand, even if it&rsquo;s just to call a taxi or hand them a bucket.  A few notable times this term I&rsquo;ve had to walk drunken friends home from events, once even with someone clutching a washing-up bowl and staggering at a snail&rsquo;s pace and insisting we were walking too fast.  And then shouting abuse at random strangers.</p>
<p>But this is fine.  While annoying, especially when it&rsquo;s a stranger, this situation is generally no more than a future banter resource.  However, it becomes more awkward when the person you have to deal with is one that you don&rsquo;t really get on with.  Whether it&rsquo;s stopping them making idiots of themselves, comforting them when they&rsquo;re abandoned in clubs, or receiving angry/flirty texts from them at 4 in the morning: these situations are not enviable.</p>
