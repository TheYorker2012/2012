		<div class="SubText">Am I a bad modern woman?</div>

        <p>Increasing numbers of friends here at university are thinking about their plans for after graduation.  A number of them (both third and second years) are applying for internships, work experience, interviews&hellip;</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m starting to feel a little left behind.  You see, I&rsquo;ve entertained the thought that  I want a career.  That I want to join a high-powered business, or even a low-powered one; enjoy networking, enjoy building contacts and going to meetings and perhaps making a career in publishing or some such business.  At school, when asked to give a gender-related word as to how we saw ourselves, I refused.  I told my teacher I didn&rsquo;t see myself in terms of being a &ldquo;lady&rdquo;, a &ldquo;girl&rdquo; or a &ldquo;woman&rdquo;:  I was a &ldquo;writer&rdquo; first and foremost.</p>
<p>Yes, I must have been insufferable, but the point is there.  I refused to give myself a gender-word, because I thought too much about the stereotypes that went with these roles.  A &ldquo;lady&rdquo; suggests sophistication and class &ndash; usually on the arm of some high-powered man; a &ldquo;woman&rdquo; implies a worldly femininity and &ldquo;girl&rdquo; has connotations of innocence  and vulnerability.</p>
<p>I wanted none of these.  I just wanted to be me, equal to any man, able to take on the world at his own game.</p>
<p>Except, my views have been changing for quite some time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve discovered I don&rsquo;t want a career.</p>
<p>Or, at least, not a conventional one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no longer fussed about beating the men at their own game.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to sit in business meetings, I don&rsquo;t want to sell my soul out to corporations, sit in an office all day and never see the sky except through the glass window.  I want to do something fulfilling&ndash; and if that&rsquo;s being a house &ldquo;wife&rdquo; and depending on someone else for income until my writing career takes off then I&rsquo;ll take that any day.</p>
<p>Because I can be a woman and still be me.  They&rsquo;re not the same thing, of course, but one can influence the other. I don&rsquo;t have to be buttonholed by it &ndash; it&rsquo;s just a word after all &ndash; but I can embrace it if I want to.</p>
<p>And I do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been told (by school, by the government, by certain acquaintances) that in this day and age, a woman shouldn&rsquo;t rely &ndash; or want to rely &ndash; on anyone else to support her.  It&rsquo;s implied that we shouldn&rsquo;t think of gender. That we should want to go out to work, get careers and stop worrying about our biological clocks so much.</p>
<p>But what they&rsquo;re really saying isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;be less feminine&rdquo;, learnt to be ignore gender and focus on yourself as people; it&rsquo;s &ldquo;be more manly&rdquo;.  Be more like a man, go to work like a man; set your priorities like a man.</p>
<p>Well, just because I hadn&rsquo;t liked defining myself with feminine gender-words at school, doesn&rsquo;t mean I wanted to define myself with masculine ones.  It&rsquo;s as though people are trying too hard to overcome the traditional stereotype, and instead of feeling pressured to start a home, I&rsquo;m certainly feeling pressured to become the high-powered, highly-stressed cooperate woman I&rsquo;ve always mistrusted.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t want to drive myself to exhaustion trying to achieve in business.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a harsh world, and if I wanted to be the best in a career (and trust me, I always, want to be the best) I&rsquo;d have to run myself ragged to make it.  I would have to make sacrifices of other things that I want and enjoy in life.</p>
<p>And I want to enjoy life and do what I want, even if it seems like an old fashioned dream.  Even if uber-feminists can accuse me of giving in to the &ldquo;patriarchy&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ll do what I like &ndash; and it won&rsquo;t be a surrender, it&rsquo;ll be a choice, thank you very much.</p>
<p>I joked recently that I wanted to be like a &ldquo;1950s housewife&rdquo;.  I wanted to be in charge of a home, have a big kitchen, enjoy cooking and cleaning and doing a hundred and one things around the house while my respective other half (and yes, I definitely want one of those) is out at work.  I regret my Home Economics classes at school didn&rsquo;t teach me anything useful and look to my mother as the ultimate inspirational figure.</p>
<p>Then I remembered my mother does have a job.  She goes out to work all day, then comes home and cooks and cleans and manages the family.  I recently spoke t her on the phone and she told me all about her day; how she&rsquo;d gotten up at eight, gone shopping, cooked a fry-up for my father and his friends, gone to work (on a Saturday) and then come home to start the washing.  My day, in comparison, had consisted of fencing, a few hours of half-hearted essay work and a pub lunch.  At the time of the phone call I was walking to a friend&rsquo;s house to eat pancakes and watch The Big Bang Theory &ndash; and, for me, that was a busy day.</p>
<p>I felt a little bit in awe.</p>
<p>I feel as though I need to stop complaining about having too much to do, and just crack on with it.  If my mother can handle a job on top of everything else, I can handle a degree and still have plenty of time for all my cleaning and washing and society work and personal relationships.  And, if later in life, I decide to continue being a writer and trying to get published, I&rsquo;m not going to let it get in the way of all those other things that I want in life.  I&rsquo;ll do both.</p>
<p>I can work and enjoy life and I&rsquo;ll do it my own way.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve come full circle &ndash; I do just want to be me.  Only now I&rsquo;ve realised that being me doesn&rsquo;t mean I have to reject my femininity.  I don&rsquo;t want to act &ldquo;like a man&rdquo;.  I want to act like me, and if that means I risk being labelled with some stupid gender stereotypes, then that&rsquo;s just something I&rsquo;ll have to put up with.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a slippery slope.  Because if I start upping my game around my student house, I&rsquo;m pretty sure my male housemates (I love them, don&rsquo;t get me wrong) would take the opportunity of doing nothing.  I have too many memories or my dad and me letting my mum do all the work around the house by espousing the &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to mess up your system&rdquo; line.</p>
<p>Although, maybe I should give them a bit more credit. I should stop being stereotypical about men if I expect them to do the same for me.  I have a male friend who absolutely loves cooking 9and he&rsquo;s an absolutely amazing cook).  He does his washing up and is one of the neatest people I know.  It&rsquo;s a sad state of affairs when, even in this day and age, he often laughs at himself for being &ldquo;too girly&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s encouraging that when I shared these thoughts with my boyfriend; he insisted that if I ever had the urge to learn how to iron his shirts properly, he&rsquo;d learn how to iron mine.</p>

<p>I love this article. I agree that you shouldn&#039;t have to be more manly, and that a female is fully in her right to accept the role of being a housewife, if that is what she desires! That girl, you are an inspiration to us all!</p>

<p>&quot;At school, when asked to give a gender-related word as to how we saw ourselves&quot;</p>
<p>What kind of weird, gender-obsessed school did you go to?</p>

<p>#2 - I don&#039;t know, I had to do a similar exercise in my school as part of a PSHE lesson on stereotypes - in my class it was to see what word we used i.e. whether we subconsciously perpetrated these stereotypes.</p>

<p>I suddenly feel grateful that my headmaster thought PSHE lessons were a total waste of time, and let teachers give English and Maths lessons in the allocated teaching block instead.</p>
<p>On the actual article: your friend shouldn&#039;t think of himself as &quot;girly&quot; just because he cooks his own food and organizes himself - just sounds like a functioning adult to me. Doing these jobs can be a time-consuming drudge (for me at least), and I understand now why it might be a good idea for one spouse to stay in the home, child rearing aside.</p>

<p>Personally, I think that so many women (and some men) have fought hard to gain you somewhat equal rights and to just turn around and say, well, thanks, but no thanks, I&#039;m going to stay in the home and not have that career you worked so hard to get me, is a little bit short-sighted.  Also you may not be lucky enough to find a husband who wants to whole-heartedly support you, so why not concentrate on the career until you do?</p>

<p>#5<br />
But why should women be forced to work when they don&#039;t want to? If a woman chooses to stay at home and care for the house then is that not her choice. Its not about denying equal rights - feminists work so that women have choice, not to force them into working when they don&#039;t want to</p>

<p>#5, equal rights gave us choice not forced us into things! YOUR view is a little short sighted, to assume all women should work because others in the past wanted to? If I can afford not to, I wont work. I love cooking, I love looking after my boyfriend and I&#039;m happy to do lots of cleaning up. I want to be a good mum and a good wife and be fulfilled in my spare time through other work. I&#039;d rather run an amazing home if I can afford to, as opposed to working because it would be &#039;short-sighted&#039; not to?</p>

<p>I often find myself feeling apathetic about a &quot;career&quot; and all the effort it takes to be successful, but I don&#039;t think I could just completely be a housewife because if worst comes to worst and you divorce/break up, where are you going to be then? Also here you&#039;ve associated &quot;career&quot; with &quot;business&quot;, there are many other things you can make money from, without &quot;selling your soul&quot;. <img src="../../images/smileys/smile.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>That&#039;s what I thought too #8 when reading this. A career does not = business, office and corporations in all cases. There are so many creative occupations that you can get involved with. You&#039;re probably going to have to earn some money at some time in your life, even if just for a short while - might as well accept it!</p>
