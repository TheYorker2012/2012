		</div>
		<div class="SubText">Earlier this week I wrote about the first five of my bad university experiences.  They were fairly serious.  This time, I&rsquo;ve got five more, this time light-hearted, experiences to share.  If light-hearted bad things makes enough sense.</div>

        <p><strong>6.</strong> First off, there&rsquo;s the problem of campus.  As in, the problem of birds.  More specifically: geese.</p>
<p>Now, previous to this summer term, I had never really paid much attention to the waterfowl on campus.  They were just part of the scenery.  The most annoying thing about them was their tendency to leave proof of their existence all over the pathways and lawns.  Oh, and in the case of the black swans, trap me inside the Derwent laundry room one afternoon.</p>
<p>However, on my way to one of my 9.15s one morning, I came across two Canadian geese and their gosling.  Now the gosling was a long, long way from the path I was walking on.  Surely I could not have been a threat?  Apparently the geese thought otherwise.
I tried to walk past, on my way to the Physics building, minding my own business, when one of the geese really went for me.  And I mean, putting the head down, flapping the wings and hissing in a way that no thing should hiss like.
I am now convinced that the Canadian geese are the spawn of Satan.  And they hate me.</p>
<p>Now I make sure I always take a bag with me: for self-defence.  No goose is getting that close again!</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> Number seven on the list?  Well, this moment came around the middle of the second term.  And it involved a lot of alcohol.</p>
<p>While I had, of course, been rather drunk in my first term (house parties are officially the best things since sliced bread), it wasn&rsquo;t until this particular time that I discovered I really, really, needed to find my limits&hellip; and remember to stop drinking when they were reached!</p>
<p>This specific incident involved &pound;2.50 treble vodka and lemonades.  Four of them to be exact.  In rather quick succession.  Needless to say, for a girl of my stature, it was enough to give me a rather messy night.  To this day I refuse to drink trebles.  And lemonade if I can avoid it.  Archers and blackcurrant squash has proved a much tastier and less risky substitute.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> Eighth on my list has got to do with house hunting.  Talk about stressful.  When you flatmates waltz in one day and announce they&rsquo;ve just laid a deposit down on a house &ndash; when you haven&rsquo;t even sorted whom you&rsquo;re living with yet &ndash; life can start to get a bit worrying&hellip;</p>
<p>Luckily we now have a house.  But we missed out on the first one we wanted, and for four inexperienced freshers, this feels like a major setback.  It meant we felt pressured into going for the very next house we saw.  Fortunately, it was rather nice, but I could have done without that pressure.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> Okay, so, no list of less-than-amazing university experiences would be complete without a reference to Ziggy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Now, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, of all the clubs in York, my best experiences have always been in Ziggy&rsquo;s.  But, unfortunately, so have the worst.</p>
<p>This particular incident involved some kind of back injury that made sitting down/generally moving around rather hellish for about four weeks.</p>
<p>The funny thing is, I don&rsquo;t even know what I did.  I assume I fell over.  I even assume it was in Ziggy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s the nature of most Ziggy&rsquo;s experiences.  In fact, maybe the bad reputation Ziggy&rsquo;s has is unjustified.  Most people can&rsquo;t remember if bad things have happened in Ziggy&rsquo;s or not.  Because they can&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> Yet there is one university experience that does, and is going to continue to, top them all.  And that&rsquo;s saying goodbye.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no good way to do this.  Earlier this year, I had to say goodbye to a flatmate who had decided university wasn&rsquo;t her thing.  In the short space of time I&rsquo;d known her, she had become one of my best friends and we were even going to live together next year. Then she left.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, one of my closest friends and actual future housemate went home for the summer.  I didn&rsquo;t think it would be so hard to say &ldquo;bon voyage&rdquo;.  Then I realised that it was going to be three months probably, before we saw each other again.   I would be lying if I said I didn&rsquo;t feel sad as we stood and watched the bus pull-off.</p>
<p>And in less than two weeks time, I&rsquo;ll be saying goodbye to everyone else.</p>
<p>Definite sad times.</p>
<p><em>But it is far from all bad! Check out That Girl from Derwent next week, as she explains why university has been the best thing in her life so far, in her top ten greatest York moments.</em></p>
