		<div class="SubText">Later this evening, as the GSA&rsquo;s Press and Publicity Officer, and LGBT Rep on the relevant YUSU Committees, I will be being auctioned off for charity in Edge from 8pm at the YUSU LGBT (Not A) Slave Auction. This is one of a series of events that has taken place over the last couple of weeks as part of YUSU LGBT&rsquo;s Love Without Borders campaign, and I am happy to be involved with what I see as a very worthy cause.</div>

        <p>Admittedly, before starting to sit on the YUSU LGBT Committee at the beginning of this term, I did not have much knowledge of LGBT issues past what I knew from some of my oldest mates being gay or bi. However, since then, I have become very interested with the issues that we deal with, and I must say that I find sitting on the LGBT Committee very rewarding, as I know that we are helping to make a difference. Before I first sat on the LGBT Committee, I went to lunch with the YUSU LGBT Officers to discuss some of the issues pertaining to the committee and my role on it. I was amazed by some of the things that were said.</p>
<p>For example, it baffles me that such things as &lsquo;bi-phobia&rsquo; and &lsquo;trans-phobia&rsquo; exist amongst the LGBT community. Moreover, I was amazed at the details into which we discussed whether or not the committee should start representing asexuals during my first meeting. For me, it wasn&rsquo;t an issue. &quot;Of course they should&quot;, I thought, and I was amazed that they didn&rsquo;t already.</p>
<p></p>

<img src="../../images/prototype/news/quote_close.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
<br /><span class="author"></span>
</div></blockquote><p>Also, something that I was aware of, but has become more prevalent in my mind recently, is how much casual homophobia still exists within society. At the &lsquo;Are LGBT Rights human rights?&rsquo; discussion that I attended last Monday, which had the subtitle &lsquo;Should the West enforce the decriminalization of homosexuality?&rsquo;, I posed the statement to the assembled panel that the West had to get its own house in order before trying to enforce acceptance of homosexuality upon the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this more true than with the passing of Proposition 8 in California during the 2008 Presidential elections. Despite not being supported by the then Democratic Presidential candidate Barack Obama, who the state of California voted resoundingly for, or California&rsquo;s own self-styled &lsquo;Governator&rsquo; Arnold Schwarzenegger, the people of California voted for Proposition 8, which now means that the state of California no longer allows same-sex marriages. Legal action is now taking place that could invalidate the same-sex marriages that had previously been administered. What makes this even more worrying is that California is regarded as one of the more accepting, liberal states of America.</p>
<p>As a heterosexual guy, I cannot claim to have any direct experience of homophobia. However, it definitely exists, and I feel that more needs to be done to get rid of it. Attitudes need to change, and fast. A homosexual is still a person. Someone who considers themselves trans-gender is still a person, and they deserve to be treated with the same dignity and respect with which you expect to be treated. Finally, terms such as &lsquo;queer&rsquo;, &lsquo;faggot&rsquo; and &lsquo;poof&rsquo; are not acceptable, regardless of if &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only meant as a joke&rdquo; or not, and lesbians do not &ldquo;just need a good seeing-to&rdquo;! Attitudes like this are antique and need to be gotten rid of.</p>
<p>Think of it this way; if your brother, sister, or closest and oldest mate was to come out as LGBT, as some of my mates have done since high school onwards, would you disown them, or would you accept it and love them the same? Quite frankly, if your answer to that isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;d accept it, as I&rsquo;ll still love them the same&rdquo;, I think you need to take a good long look at yourself.</p>

<p>Great to see a heterosexual on the committee. I would identify myself as bi but have never felt at home at York&#039;s LGBT. I think it&#039;s less their lack of acceptance but York as a whole. It&#039;s such a small city and the LGBT &quot;sector&quot; is too small for me to find likeminded people.</p>
<p>Femininity is not at all, in my case, concomitant with my sexual interest in members of the same sex. At all the LGBT events I&#039;ve been too it&#039;s hard to find a guy who is principally &quot;masculine&quot; and also gay or bi; effeminacy always comes with it. This is not a criticism - it is essential of course that everyone can be what is in them to be. But I do wonder, there must be some guys or girls out there where gender identity is separate to sexuality?</p>
<p>I am really only &quot;myself&quot; in larger cities, a trip to Leeds is greatly liberating and is one of my key saviours from states of depression in what appears to me (perhaps naively) to be a place where I don&#039;t belong.</p>

<p>Great article. I still think that it&#039;s good to have heterosexual people on LGBT committee where possible.</p>
<p>And yes, there are plenty of gay men who aren&#039;t the typical effeminate male. I&#039;ve met people like that. And there are both ends of the spectrum stereotyped for lesbians - even though these are obvious when you think about it, I suspect that there&#039;s still a massive amount of stigma regarding things that the article points out and it&#039;s a real shame. Things will change, though.</p>

<p>#3 &quot;There are plenty of gay men who aren&#039;t the typical effeminate male&quot;. Do you realise just how crass and offensive that is?</p>

<p>Hi #2. I think it&#039;s a great shame that you don&#039;t feel like you belong in York, especially if it puts you in a state of depression.</p>
<p>It&#039;s also a shame that you don&#039;t feel at home at YUSU LGBT events, as I know that we as a committee really do try to cater for everyone under our remit.</p>
<p>If you&#039;d like, I would be very willing to talk to you privately about any concerns you have, especially given that you&#039;ve used the term &#039;lack of acceptance&#039; when mentioning York LGBT, and pass these concerns on to the committee so that we can go about changing things and start representing you and anyone else who may have similiar concerns better.</p>
<p>Contact me any time on publicity@yorkgsa.org.</p>

<p>I think the California prop 8 question was a skewed one.</p>
<p>Marriage being between a man and a woman has been pretty standard thought for centuries and  appears &#039;normal&#039; to most people.</p>
<p>&#039;This state would prohibit gay marriage&#039; may have gained a different response, i for one believe it would have been overturned with this wording.</p>
<p>As a heterosexual male i find the York LGBT group very accepting indeed. Despite not having a clue about some of the more academic stuff about gender theories etc... most events at York are relevant to society as a whole, engaging and varied. The past week&#039;s campaign is testament to this.</p>
<p>Congrats to all involved. <img src="../../smileys/shade_smirk.html" alt="" /></p>

<p>#4, shut up. It&#039;s not offensive. It was responding to #2&#039;s comment that it&#039;s &quot;been too it&#039;s hard to find a guy who is principally &quot;masculine&quot; and also gay&quot; - and it&#039;s a perfectly accurate point. Don&#039;t take offense at nothing, please.</p>
<p>And yes, this campaign has been informative and well-thought-through. Kudos to the LGBT committee and anyone else involved in organising.</p>

<p>Well that&#039;s nice Jason, #4shut up. I&#039;m not sure that one person&#039;s experience gives you an evidence base to suggest that the &#039;typical&#039; (as you put it) gay man is effeminate.</p>
<p>I must say that your response to #4 was a little hypocritical coming from someone who has found offense with pretty much every story or discussion thread posted on here and Nouse.</p>
