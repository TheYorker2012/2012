		<div class="Author">

		</div>
		<div class="SubText">A few weeks ago, The Yorker reported that Ryan Bennett, former Vanbrugh Chair, was dropping out of the YUSU Presidential Race. Today, he reviews the candidates and their policies.</div>

        <p>The presidential candidates have begun their race, and let&#039;s be honest, even with Wentworth bar full to the brim for hustings, and posters plastered around campus, how many students really know what&rsquo;s going on? Over the campaigning fortnight, candidates will promise you pretty much anything for your vote in such a close race. Many of their policies may be eye-catching, but without knowing all the facts, how do you pick out the right one?</p>

<ul><li><strong>Nadeem Kunwar</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>Nadz has presented a list of attention-grabbing policies. His idea of an online module rating system is interesting, but with students already fed up with filling in numerous feedback forms to their department, would this really be a success? He claims to have to have contacted departments to release this information to no avail, but would it not be a better idea to take the issue higher at a university level?</p>
<p>He has promised to carry out a campus-wide Hes East Survey. Whether anything beneficial will come from this is unclear as notoriously only a select few will reply, and the results will most probably be a central venue, environmental effects, facilities, and keeping the college atmosphere. All of which are currently being addressed by the University. Since it would be printed, can he justify the cost?</p>
<p>As for a free media, this could be rather controversial. Media outlets in York are award-winning institutions, and of course should be supported in every way possible, but there has to be a clear line between news and the welfare of students. The media charter already in place seems to be doing its job just right, so why change it?</p>
<p>His suggestion of splitting the role of academic and welfare officer into two separate positions was possibly not thought through completely, as there is currently a paid external consultant who is assessing the roles of union employees, and presenting it shortly. Pre-empting the decisions would be a mistake and a clear waste of money which has already been spent.</p>
<p>Finally Nadz seems to be rather confused over what the president&rsquo;s role is, promising an international Viking Raid. Clearly his experience as an Ents officer would have better suited the role of Services and Finance, and when asked about his experience of campaigning, which is one of the presidents main roles, he admitted that other than assisting with Barcott in 2005/6, it was non-existent.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Laura Payne</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>Laura&rsquo;s campaign has revolved around the traditional major student annoyances such as bridges, buses, kitchens and portering. None of these are particularly controversial and would appeal to the majority. But are they achievable?</p>
<p>Laura has certainly demonstrated real campaign experience with respect to the opening up of Women&rsquo;s Committee and the recent NUS referendum, a quality which is very much a necessity in any president. However, these have tended to be UGM and YUSU orientated, how she would deal with commercial opposition in the form of the Estates Department, Bars and First is less clear.</p>
<p>When quizzed at debates she has knowledge of where these issues currently sit, and mostly promises to continue the ongoing work. With a bit of digging through her facebook group you can also find how she plans to deliver on her &lsquo;Buses, Bridges, Bars&rsquo; promise, with sensible strategies, such as a Buscott with a replacement YUSU minibus service. Although a lot of this campaigning seems to have been fairly recent, and will she be able to encourage large numbers of students to follow in protest?</p>
<p>There are also some more innovative ideas: she has suggested that students may be able to volunteer to help keep the library open longer. Whether or not this is feasible is debatable, but it&rsquo;s a possible solution rather than a promise and such thinking tends to be exactly what University committees need.</p>
<p>Laura has played it safe, relying on her superior experience in campaigns and representation to oppose Nadz&rsquo;s more Ents-orientated approach. Her experience would naturally lead her towards the role of president, though only being a second year you could suggest she has a year less experience of Uni life in general.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Mad Cap&rsquo;n Tom Scott</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>It was generally thought at the start of campaigning that the captain was some what of a joke candidate, and it&rsquo;s probably true that he expected it to be seen this way, especially given some of his rather interesting policies. Of course it would be great to have a canon on central hall, and I for one would love my own cutlass, but, to be honest, we all know it is not going to happen any time soon.</p>
<p>However over the past week the Captain has demonstrated an in-depth knowledge into many issues and has been able to identify the fundamental problems and their solutions. Being the first candidate to understand the real reasons as to why York has fallen in recent league tables, and even reveal the difficulties of altering funding for the library quickly given that the budgets are set years in advance.</p>
<p>The other candidates&#039; experiences have mostly come from within YUSU, and it can be easy for them not to notice some of the smaller issues which affect a lot of students. When quizzed on problems with communication in YUSU the Captain was able to speak passionately and bring examples from personal experience when he was a society chair, and how he would sort them out. This outside experience is a real advantage compared to the other candidates who are both well inside the YUSU fold.</p>
<p>Mad Cap&rsquo;n Tom has certainly impressed with his answers given in debates, and it would be beneficial if these could be known on a wider scale through posters or his facebook group. Although one important question still remains: given he has promised to stay in character for the entire year, how seriously would a pirate be taken in university meetings?</p>

<ul><li><strong>Who to <a href="http://www.yusu.org/vote">vote</a> for?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>The week may have started off as a two-horse race between Laura and Nadz, but Mad Cap&rsquo;n Tom really has been shown to be a credible candidate leaving the possibilities wide open. A poll by <em>Nouse</em> suggests Laura to be in the lead, one by URY has given the Captain a huge majority, and <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> gives Nadz the edge.</p>
<p>It seems too close to call between all three, and the winner will be the one who can really convince the ordinary student that they are the person for the job. Whoever you&rsquo;re thinking of voting for, make sure they have a plan of action, a clear idea of how to deliver on their promises and the experience to get things done. Take up their offer to ask them personal questions &ndash; they all supposedly want an open YUSU, why not see if they can perform now?</p>

<p>Ryan Bennett suggests that the as Ents Officer Nadz is not suited for President, but Laura as Womens&#039; Officer has &quot;superior experience in representation&quot; and would make a better president. Seems a loaded assessment.</p>

<p>Umm...Ryan&#039;s been around around long enough. And would have made a pretty good candidate himself. I reckon he probably knows what he&#039;s talking about.</p>

<p>Firstly, I think it&#039;s important to remember, that despite his experience, Ryan has a personal dislike of Nadz.</p>
<p>This is clear in his one-sided critique of Nadz&#039;s policies, followed by a rose-tinted view of Laura. For instance, he claims her bus policies represent &quot;sensible strategies, such as a Buscott with a replacement YUSU minibus service.&quot; How on earth will one YUSU minibus, capacity 14, replace an FTR every 15 minutes (or so) with a capacity  around four times the size? It simply wont.</p>
<p>Of course Ryan makes some good point, but look beyond his cheap shots.</p>

<p>Just remember this is a blog, please don&#039;t go getting your knickers in a twist because it carried some opinion - opinion which actually made it interesting to read.</p>
<p>I personally don&#039;t see the pirate costume being much of a problem in meetings, they&#039;d spice up the minutes, piss off people like Cantor - and they&#039;d be able to do nothing about it. He was elected democratically - the students have spoken!</p>
<p>Seriously though, Go Nadz x</p>

<p>Like #5, I would like to reiterate that this *is* a blog, and, as such, expresses the opinion of the writer only (Ryan Bennett), thus, it is likely to carry a bias-- whether it be &quot;personal dislike&quot; or &quot;experience.&quot;</p>

<p>Firstly#3, I&#039;d just like to make it clear that i dislike none of the candidates, and although you may believe i have presented a rose-tinted view of Laura as opposed to Nadz, this is simple not true.  I have simply looked through the candidates policies and experience.</p>
<p>By no means do i believe that the idea of a replacement bus service is completely perfect yet, but at least it is an idea of how to make a change which has the real possibility of working, as opposed to just listing goals.  So many candidates in the past have promised the earth, but never delivered because they never really had an idea of how to deliver.</p>

<ol><li>5 is right, this is just my opinion.  However feel free to disagree, but at least back it up with a reason why you think i am wrong.  And don&#039;t bother to accuse me of having no balls if you have to post anonymously.
