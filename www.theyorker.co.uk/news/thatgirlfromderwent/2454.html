        <p><strong>According to Liam Byrne MP, Minister of State for Borders and Immigration, Britain is currently undergoing &ldquo;the biggest shake up of [its] immigration system for 45 years&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p>The new, stricter regulations, which are meant to tighten border control, will introduce a point-system and contain one section &ndash; Tier 4 &ndash; that applies specifically to international students.</p>
<p>Over the last three years, more than 300 colleges have been removed from the Register of Education and Training Providers. According to the Department for Universities and Skills, those were sham institutions that provided no legitimate qualifications, while effectively opening a &#039;backdoor&#039; entry to the UK for economic migrants masquerading as students.</p>
<p>Under the new regulations, all educational institutions will need a licence to teach international students and all courses will have to lead to a minimum approved qualification. Meanwhile, the requirements to get a student-visa will be changing and all higher education providers will be checked by the UK Border Agency.</p>
<p>However, while preventing the abuse of student-visas as a means of gaining entry to the UK is understandable, and is largely dealt with by the above regulations, some of the additional measures that will be enforced raise many concerns over their necessity and effectiveness. In fact, the most controversial of those will only apply once a student has already moved to the UK.</p>
<p>To start with, overseas students (that is to say, international students coming from outside the EU) will be required to carry a biometric ID card. Putting ethical considerations aside for a moment, one can see that this measure can only apply once a student has already been accepted in a ministry-approved institution, has already been given a new visa and has already arrived in Britain. In other words, a biometric ID card will only be issued after we have already established, to the best of our knowledge, that the student in question is in fact perfectly legitimate.</p>
<p>In addition, the government will be checking and recording the fingerprints of everyone applying for a new, or extended, student visa. But according to Universities UK, there are only six fingerprinting centres in Britain that overseas students will have to use. They add: &ldquo;This will inevitably lead to inconvenience with long [and costly] journeys for some students, and long queuing times in the absence of a booking system.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="author"></span>
</div></blockquote><p>More worryingly, starting from September 2009 universities will be expected to monitor the attendance of overseas students on courses. Student unions as well as academics from several universities have already expressed their concerns, and some have stated that they are not willing to enter a spying-game with their students, whose absence they will be supposed to report to the UK Border Agency. As reported by <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>, academics presented a petition with 4,500 signatures, which was delivered to Downing Street last week.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<img src="../../images/prototype/news/quote_open.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
It is important that we question what is it that justifies the violation of privacy and the singling out of overseas students.

<br /><span class="author"></span>
</div></blockquote><p>Taking into consideration the wider opposition to the Orwellian principles of those measures, it is important that we question what is it that justifies the violation of privacy and the singling out of overseas students, given that the &quot;bogus colleges&rdquo; will have already been targeted and stamped out under the ministry checks/approvals and the tougher student-visa requirements. But so far, on the few occasions where this matter has been publicly discussed, the only real concern seems to be whether this will have an adverse effect on the number of foreign applicants. According to the Home Office, overseas currently contribute &pound;2.5bn to the UK economy in tuition fees alone and as much as &pound;8.5bn to the wider economy. The Quality Assurance Agency has stated that many universities are now financially dependent on overseas students.</p>
<p>The truth is that the introduction of those measures has taken aback both current and prospective international students. Those decisions seem to have been premised on the rather baseless assumption that the overwhelming majority of the 220,000 legitimate student-visa holders should be paying the price for a problem that they did not by any means create.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<img src="../../images/prototype/news/quote_open.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
Getting accepted into Oxbridge or York just to get out of one&rsquo;s nation is not just an unlikely prospect; it is simply irrational.
<img src="../../images/prototype/news/quote_close.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
<br /><span class="author"></span>
</div></blockquote><p>One can not reasonably argue, however, why a student attending a course in a serious academic institution in the UK, paying a life&#039;s worth of savings in tuition fees, should have to endure going through this contemptuous and clearly unnecessary procedure. Getting accepted into Oxbridge or York just to get out of one&rsquo;s nation is not just an unlikely prospect; it is simply irrational.</p>
<p>By treating all overseas students as potential elaborate lawbreakers or, at best, as a mindless, lucrative source of revenue, the message that is being sent out is loud and clear; and unfortunately it is not a very positive one.</p>
<p>Alternative solutions are not only possible; as a matter of fact they could be considerably more efficient too. Through a more careful consideration of the situation, the new sensible regulations concerning student-visa requirements and ministry approvals/checks could be followed by the adoption of more thoughtful and less encroaching measures, specifically targeting false colleges and crime offenders without indiscriminately putting everyone else in the same box.</p>

<p>It does seem rather hysterical to seriously infringe the civil liberties of international students just to clamp down on illegal immigration but what is possibly more worrying is the lack of public discussion.</p>

<p>#2, it&#039;s not a case of &quot;keepng up with Labour Party news.&quot; It just shows a pretty shoddy knowledge of basic facts which thus brings into question how accurate the rest of your article is.</p>

<ul id="CommentItem5160History" class="comment_edit"><li>Fri, 2nd Oct 2009 1:35pm - Edited by the author</li></ul><p>Dear &quot;Anonymous&quot;,</p>
<p>What you are saying would be true if not keeping up with the details of October&#039;s cabinet reshuffle actually made any difference to the validity of the argumentation, to the accuracy of this (insignificant) quote (at the time, Liam Byrne did hold that position after all), or to the knowledge of the actual decisions that have been taken on that issue.</p>
<p>Given that this is demonstrably not the case, as you can easily find out by yourself, the only thing it really shows is a lack of interest in the labour party and the fate of its ministers. On that charge, and on the heinous act of omitting a &quot;former&quot;, I declare guilty.</p>
<p>There are many rational arguments one can contribute to this discussion from either side, so I do suggest we focus on those rather than choose to resort to pedantic factoids.</p>
<p>If you have any objections feel free to raise them and I&#039;d be more than happy to try to answer, but I am afraid that attempts to wave off or diminish an  issue by trivializing it have no place in a serious discussion.</p>

<p>I don&#039;t see the biometric cards as an issue in the slightest - I was fingerprinted at the airport in the USA on arrival and my fingerprint data is in the EU databanks as well. The biometric ID card is coming into effect regardless of this issue and since they already announced they&#039;ll be starting with immigrants, it makes sense. Likewise I don&#039;t think there are only 6 fingerprinting centres in the UK as, for instance, all police stations can take fingerprints and put them on file so I&#039;d guess that the 6 places mentioned will be the 6 that students in particular will use - and so there won&#039;t be massive delays because they&#039;ll know exactly how many they have to cater for. Most people get NUS cards on time despite the massive amount of application forms and photos they get in a week or two, don&#039;t they?</p>
<p>But the issue of treating all foreigners as potential criminals is very Daily Mail and having stricter attendance records for them than UK students is a bit harsh. Making sure that they don&#039;t do a runner is fair but having attendence sheets just for foreign students is a bit segregational for my liking!</p>
<p>8/10 for trying to fix something that is an issue, 4/10 for implementation. <img src="../../images/smileys/rasberry.gif" alt="" /></p>
