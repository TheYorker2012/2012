        <p><strong>04:47</strong> That&#039;s all folks! Thanks for following us tonight - and well done for those of you who stuck it out until the end. We&#039;re off to bed to make sure we&#039;re awake enough for our seminars and lectures tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>04:45</strong> All the winners this night are coming forward to join the kids. Melissa Leo is singing along!</p>
<p><strong>04:44</strong> Now it&#039;s time for the closing song from a group of primary school kids from Staten Island. They&#039;re pretty cute, but singing &#039;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&#039; may just be a dollop too much of cheese to bear.</p>
<p><strong>04:42</strong> The production team are thanking the director, acting team and crew. To be honest, the team on stage at the moment look very unexcited. You just won Best Picture - celebrate!</p>
<p><strong>04:40</strong> Matching up its BAFTA, <em>The King&#039;s Speech</em> has had quite a good sweep of the night for Best Picture, Actor and Director.</p>
<p><strong>04:40</strong> The winner is ... <em>The King&#039;s Speech</em>!</p>
<p><strong>04:37</strong> Steven Spielberg here to present the Best Picture nominees. We&#039;re having a detailed round-up of them now.</p>
<p><strong>04:37</strong> Now, Steven Spielberg&#039;s here to present the award for Best Picture, the nominees are: <em>Black Swan</em>, <em>The Fighter</em>, <em>Inception</em>, <em>The Kids Are All Right</em>, <em>The King&#039;s Speech</em>, <em>127 Hours</em>, <em>The Social Network</em>, <em>Toy Story 3</em>, <em>True Grit</em> and <em>Winter&#039;s Bone</em>.</p>
<p><strong>04:36</strong> Anne&#039;s in another dress, which is almost a nun costume! Sparkling chocolate long sleeved, floor length, choking all the way to her neck...jeez, why so covered up?</p>
<p><strong>04:34</strong> There&#039;s only one award left - Best Picture. And 25 minutes left to present it!</p>
<p><strong>04:34</strong> All in all, a lovely heartfelt speech, giving credit where it&#039;s due to everyone. Well done Colin!</p>
<p><strong>04:32</strong> Colin Firth joking that his career has now peaked :) Apparently he&#039;s suppressing an urge to dance. Please dance Colin! He&#039;s very calm and collected, shining a spotlight on the whole King&#039;s Speech team. Acknowledging Tom Ford &quot;to whom I owe a very big piece of this&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>04:30</strong> The Oscar goes to the deserving Colin Firth for his powerful performance in <em>The King&#039;s Speech</em>.</p>
<p><strong>04:25</strong> Like Bridges, she&#039;s addressing each actor personally - and even engaging in a little bit of banter!</p>
<p><strong>04:24</strong> Sandra Bullock is now out to present Best Actor. Cute big bow in the back of her dress we didn&#039;t see before!</p>
<p><strong>04:24</strong> The nominees for Best Actor are: Javier Bardem (<em>Biutiful</em>), Jeff Bridges (<em>True Grit</em>), Jesse Eisenberg (<em>The Social Network</em>), Colin Firth (<em>The King&#039;s Speech</em>), James Franco (<em>127 Hours</em>).</p>
<p><strong>04:23</strong> Thanking all the team that helped train her for the film, and her fiance for giving her &quot;the greatest role of her life&quot; - aw! She&#039;s also shining a light on the crew who are usually underappreciated. She managed to cover a lot of ground in a short space of time!</p>
<p><strong>04:22</strong> She&#039;s tearing up, thanking her parents for letting her work in acting and teaching her to be a good person. Thanking all her professional staff, her friends and Darren Aronofsky for being able to work with him.</p>
<p><strong>04:21</strong> Natalie has had a clean sweep of the awards recently...good for her! She looks like she could give birth at any minute.</p>
<p><strong>04:20</strong> And the winner, as we all expected, is Natalie Portman for <em>Black Swan</em>!</p>
<p><strong>04:17</strong> He&#039;s taking his time to personally address each nominee before their clip is played. I guess we have 45 minutes of time to fill for three awards!</p>
<p><strong>04:16</strong> Jeff Bridges is out to present Best Actress.</p>
<p><strong>04:16</strong> The nominees for Best Actress are: Annette Bening (<em>The Kids Are All Right</em>), Nicole Kidman (<em>Rabbit Hole</em>), Jennifer Lawrence (<em>Winter&#039;s Bone</em>), Natalie Portman (<em>Black Swan</em>), Michelle Williams (<em>Blue Valentine</em>).</p>
<p><strong>04:12</strong> The winners of the lifetime achievement awards have been brought out - Francis Ford Coppola, Eli Wallach and Kevin Brownlow.</p>
<p><strong>04:11</strong> Annette Bening is presenting the highlights from this year&#039;s Governers&#039; Ball.</p>
<p><strong>04:09</strong> Lois has been getting increasingly annoyed with all the thanking of families this evening, but Tom Hooper&#039;s mum is relevant to his win, so she&#039;ll allow it.</p>
<p><strong>04:09</strong> Although he did win the Director&#039;s Guild Award - it&#039;s quite unusual for the winners of those two awards to differ.</p>
<p><strong>04:07</strong> And the winner is - Tom Hooper for <em>The King&#039;s Speech</em>! A bit of a surprise; we were expecting this to go to David Fincher for <em>The Social Network</em>.</p>
<p><strong>04:06</strong> The nominees for Best Director are: Darren Aronofsky (<em>Black Swan</em>), David O. Russell (<em>The Fighter</em>), Tom Hooper (<em>The King&#039;s Speech</em>), David Fincher (<em>The Social Network</em>) and Joel Coen and Ethan Coen (<em>True Grit</em>)</p>
<p><strong>04:06</strong> Kathryn Bigelow (last year&#039;s winner) is out to present the award for Best Director with Hilary Swank.</p>
<p><strong>04:05</strong> Anne&#039;s changed again! Off the shoulder navy blue; kind of reflective...is that vinyl?</p>
<p><strong>04:01</strong> Halle Berry now paying homage to Lena Horne as the first black actress to sign with MGM. A clip of Lena singing.</p>
<p><strong>03:59</strong> Most notorious of the remembered include Tony Curtis, Leslie Nielsen, Susannah York, Dennis Hopper, Blake Edwards and Pete Postlethwaite.</p>
<p><strong>03:57</strong> It&#039;s time for the In Memoriam section. Celine Dion is on stage singing &#039;Smile&#039; (Charlie Chaplin).</p>
<p><strong>03:52</strong> A little bit of a shame to not give it to someone different...I&#039;m sure Randy&#039;s running out of room for Oscars on his mantlepiece.</p>
<p><strong>03:51</strong> The award goes to Randy Newman for &quot;We Belong Together&quot; from <em>Toy Story 3</em>.</p>
<p><strong>03:50</strong> If Florence made the mistake of matching her dress to her hair, Gwyneth&#039;s made the even worse one of matching hers to her skin. Awkward.</p>
<p><strong>03:50</strong> Up next is the award for Best Original Song, the nominees are: &quot;Coming Home&quot; (<em>Country Strong</em>), &quot;I See the Light&quot; (<em>Tangled</em>), &quot;If I Rise&quot; (<em>127 Hours</em>), &quot;We Belong Together&quot; (<em>Toy Story 3</em>)</p>
<p><strong>03:49</strong> And finally...Gwyneth Paltrow in a gold dress singing &#039;Country Strong&#039; from the eponymous film. She&#039;s everywhere these days - Glee, the Grammys...she sounds pretty flat. Matches her personality.</p>
<p><strong>03:47</strong> We&#039;re back to the original song performances - A.R. Rahman and Florence Welch are up singing &#039;If I Rise&#039;. She&#039;s changed her horrible dress into a copper satin number which is much more becoming of her...although it does match her hair a little too closely.</p>
<p><strong>03:46</strong> Another dress change for Anne Hathaway - pretty, sparkly, red. Lovely, we think, and it&#039;s amazing that her hair has been restyled this many times.</p>
<p><strong>03:40</strong> Inception&#039;s on a roll this evening for technical awards.</p>
<p><strong>03:39</strong> The winners are Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter for <em>The Social Network</em>.</p>
<p><strong>03:39</strong> The next award is for Best Film Editing, the nominees are <em>Black Swan</em> (Andrew Weisblum), <em>The Fighter</em> (Pamela Martin), <em>The King&#039;s Speech</em> (Tariq Anwar), <em>127 Hours</em> (Jon Harris), <em>The Social Network</em> (Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter)</p>
<p><strong>03:37</strong> The Oscar, unsurprisingly, goes to <em>Inception</em>.</p>
<p><strong>03:35</strong> Up now is the award for Best Visual Effects, the nominees are: <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> (Ken Ralston, David Schaub, Carey Villegas and Sean Phillips), <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I</em> (Tim Burke, John Richardson, Christian Manz and Nicolas Aithadi), <em>Hereafter</em> (Michael Owens, Bryan Grill, Stephan Trojansky and Joe Farrell), <em>Inception</em> (Paul Franklin, Chris Corbould, Andrew Lockley and Peter Bebb), <em>Iron Man 2</em> (Janek Sirrs, Ben Snow, Ged Wright and Daniel Sudick)</p>
<p><strong>03:34</strong> Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law are out to present the award for Best Visual Effects. They&#039;re cute in their matching white tie and bowtie.</p>
<p><strong>03:33</strong> We&#039;re being treated to a flashback to the first televised Oscars. Using what appears to be hologram technology to make it look like Bob Hope&#039;s really there...kinda creepy.</p>
<p><strong>03:30</strong> He&#039;s received a collective standing ovation from the audience.</p>
<p><strong>03:29</strong> Anne&#039;s back in her tassle dress. She&#039;s introducing &quot;one of the greatest Oscar hosts of all time&quot; Billy Crystal.</p>
<p><strong>03:25</strong> Winners protesting the fact that no bankers have gone to jail yet, despite causing a huge financial crisis. Ah, a political platform.</p>
<p><strong>03:24</strong> The winner is <em>Inside Job</em> (Charles Ferguson and Audrey Marrs).</p>
<p><strong>03:23</strong> Oprah&#039;s here to present the award for Best Documentary, here&#039;s the nominees: <em>Exit through the Gift Shop</em> (Banksy and Jaimie D&#039;Cruz), <em>Gasland</em> (Josh Fox and Trish Adlesic), <em>Inside Job</em> (Charles Ferguson and Audrey Marrs), <em>Restrepo</em> (Tim Hetherington and Sebastian Junger), <em>Waste Land</em> (Lucy Walker and Angus Aynsley).</p>
<p><strong>03:22</strong> The Coen brothers look distinctly unimpressed by Oprah&#039;s speech.</p>
<p><strong>03:22</strong> We love a bit of Oprah here. But her breasts look massive in that dress.</p>
<p><strong>03:21</strong> Anne flaunting a tassle 1920s inspired dress she&#039;s changed into, after we were just treated to some autotuned clips from Harry Potter and Twilight, among others.</p>
<p><strong>03:16</strong> <em>God Of Love</em> wins Live Action Short Film.</p>
<p><strong>03:14</strong> <em>Strangers No More</em> wins Best Documentary Short Subject.</p>
<p><strong>03:09</strong> OK, so apparently we&#039;re going to ad break rather than hearing the other nominees (for now).</p>
<p><strong>03:08</strong> Yay, <em>Chuck</em>! (on behalf of Lois and Simon)</p>
<p><strong>03:07</strong> This is edge-of-your-seat stuff...will Mandy Moore hit the high note?</p>
<p><strong>03:06</strong> Next, we have Alan Menken&#039;s &#039;I See The Light&#039; performed by Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi from <em>Tangled</em>. She&#039;s changed into a regal feathery blue gown.</p>
<p><strong>03:05</strong> We&#039;re hearing all the original song nominees - first up is 20-time (!) nominee Randy Newman for &#039;We Belong Together&#039; from <em>Toy Story 3</em>. He&#039;s rather jaunty at the piano.</p>
<p><strong>03:04</strong> Judging by our reactions during that montage, <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span>&#039;s favourite &#039;Best Original Song&#039; winner is &#039;Falling Slowly&#039; from <em>Once</em>.</p>
<p><strong>03:03</strong> President Obama has made a cameo, declaring his favourite movie song to be &#039;As Time Goes By&#039;.</p>
<p><strong>03:02</strong> Really? Reading off a piece of paper like a university student in a seminar? For goodness&#039; sake woman, speak from the heart!</p>
<p><strong>03:01</strong> Colleen Atwood is a bit of a legend in the costume design industry in Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>03:00</strong> The award goes to Colleen Atwood for <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>.</p>
<p><strong>02:59</strong> Up next is the award for Costume Design, the nominees are: Alice in Wonderland (<em>Colleen Atwood</em>), I Am Love (<em>Antonella Cannarozzi</em>), The King&#039;s Speech (<em>Jenny Beavan</em>), The Tempest (<em>Sandy Powell</em>), True Grit (<em>Mary Zophres</em>)</p>
<p><strong>02:58</strong> Nominees for best make-up are Barney&#039;s Version, The Way Back and The Wolfman - the winner is <strong>The Wolfman<em>. It&#039;s Rick Baker&#039;s 7th Academy Award.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>02:56</strong> The lesson we&#039;ve learned is that every technical engineer in Hollywood is a man.</p>
<p><strong>02:56</strong> Marisa Tomei and her abundant mermaid dress are out to show a highlight reel for the technical awards.</p>
<p><strong>02:51</strong> That&#039;s a third win for <em>Inception</em> - it&#039;s having a good night. Maybe bodes well for an upset later?</p>
<p><strong>02:51</strong> And the winner is... <em>Inception</em> once again. They apparently are the kings of sound.</p>
<p><strong>02:50</strong> Sound Editing - and the nominees are <em>Inception</em> (Richard King), <em>Toy Story 3</em> (Tom Myers and Michael Silvers), <em>Tron: Legacy</em> (Gwendolyn Yates Whittle and Addison Teague), <em>True Grit</em> (Skip Lievsay and Craig Berkey) and <em>Unstoppable</em> (Mark P. Stoeckinger).</p>
<p><strong>02:49</strong> The winners for Sound Mixing are Lora Hirschberg, Gary A. Rizzo and Ed Novick for <em>Inception</em>.</p>
<p><strong>02:49</strong> Here are the nominees for Best Sound Mixing: <em>Inception</em> (Lora Hirschberg, Gary A. Rizzo and Ed Novick), <em>The King&#039;s Speech</em> (Paul Hamblin, Martin Jensen and John Midgley), <em>Salt</em> (Jeffrey J. Haboush, Greg P. Russell, Scott Millan and William Sarokin), <em>The Social Network</em> (Ren Klyce, David Parker, Michael Semanick and Mark Weingarten), <em>True Grit</em> (Skip Lievsay, Craig Berkey, Greg Orloff and Peter F. Kurland)</p>
<p><strong>02:48</strong> Scarlett Johansson and Matthew McConaghey are presenting for Sound Mixing. She has sex hair.</p>
<p><strong>02:47</strong> I&#039;ve got to say, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross both have brilliant names.</p>
<p><strong>02:47</strong> Winners are thanking David Fincher and the whole team behind The Social Network. And their wives.</p>
<p><strong>02:45</strong> The winners are Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for <em>The Social Network</em>!</p>
<p><strong>02:43</strong> We&#039;re now listening to some classic scores, including Star Wars, E.T. and West Side Story.</p>
<p><strong>02:43</strong> The nominees for Best Original Score are <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em> (John Powell), <em>Inception</em> (Hans Zimmer), <em>The King&#039;s Speech</em> (Alexandre Desplat), <em>127 Hours</em> (A.R. Rahman), <em>The Social Network</em> (Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross)</p>
<p><strong>02:42</strong> They&#039;re really pushing the clips of classic Hollywood. They seem really disjointed with the rest of the ceremony.</p>
<p><strong>02:41</strong> Anne&#039;s changed again into some overly-decorated hair, with a black dress and sheer overlay.</p>
<p><strong>02:38</strong> The Award for Best Original Score is coming up, I&#039;m personally extremely glad that the beautiful music from <em>How To Train Your Dragon</em> has been nominated, but I think that Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross will win for <em>The Social Network</em></p>
<p><strong>02:35</strong> The mockney accent has calmed down a little, although the beard is, unfortunately, still in existence. Nice plug for Dicky Eckland&#039;s training studio.</p>
<p><strong>02:34</strong> Disappointed that Geoffrey Rush didn&#039;t win, I thought his performance in <em>The King&#039;s Speech</em> was really impressive.</p>
<p><strong>02:33</strong> The award goes to Christian Bale (<em>The Fighter</em>)!</p>
<p><strong>02:32</strong> The Award for Best Supporting Actor is up next. The nominees are: Christian Bale (<em>The Fighter</em>), John Hawkes (<em>Winter&#039;s Bone</em>), Jeremy Renner (<em>The Town</em>), Mark Ruffalo (<em>The Kids Are All Right</em>), Geoffrey Rush (<em>The King&#039;s Speech</em>)</p>
<p><strong>02:29</strong> And the winner is <em>In a Better World</em>!</p>
<p><strong>02:29</strong> Next up is Best Foreign Language Film, the nominees are: <em>Biutiful</em>, <em>Dogtooth</em>, <em>In a Better World</em>, <em>Incendies</em>, <em>Outside the Law (Hors-la-loi)</em></p>
<p><strong>02:27</strong> James Franco has just turned up in a dress and made a Charlie Sheen joke!</p>
<p><strong>02:21</strong> Charming speech, but then you&#039;d expect nothing less from a writer.</p>
<p><strong>02:20</strong> The winner for Best Original Screenplay is <em>The King&#039;s Speech</em>!</p>
<p><strong>02:19</strong> Now it&#039;s the Award for Best Original Screenplay, the nominees are: <em>Another Year</em>, <em>The Fighter</em>, <em>Inception</em>, <em>The Kids Are All Right</em>, <em>The King&#039;s Speech</em></p>
<p><strong>02:16</strong> Aaron Sorkin wins for <em>The Social Network</em>!</p>
<p><strong>02:15</strong> Award for best Adapted Screenplay is up next: the nominees are <em>127 Hours</em>, <em>The Social Network</em>, <em>Toy Story 3</em>, <em>True Grit</em>, <em>Winter&#039;s Bone</em>.</p>
<p><strong>02:10</strong> Wish <em>How To Train Your Dragon</em> could&#039;ve won, but that&#039;s probably because I have <a href="4592.html">a ridiculous amount of love</a> for that film.</p>
<p><strong>02:07</strong> The winner is...<em>Toy Story 3</em>, rather unsurprisingly.</p>
<p><strong>02:06</strong> The nominees for Best Animated Feature are <em>The Illusionist</em>, <em>How To Train Your Dragon</em> and <em>Toy Story 3</em></p>
<p><strong>02:05</strong> Winner is <em>The Lost Thing</em>. Gutted <em>Day &amp; Night</em> missed out (which was the cute short at the beginning of <em>Toy Story 3</em> - won&#039;t lie, it made me cry when I saw it, as did the movie itself about 3 times).</p>
<p><strong>02:04</strong> Best Animated short nominees: Day and night, the gruffalo, let&#039;s pollute, the lost thing and Madagascar: carnet do voyage.</p>
<p><strong>02:02</strong> Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are on now...interesting pairing since there&#039;s rumours between the two of them.</p>
<p><strong>02:02</strong> Love how Anne Hathaway keeps drawing attention to the fact that its the &quot;young and hip&quot; Oscars!</p>
<p><strong>02:00</strong> She&#039;s doing her round of thanks to all the team on <em>The Fighter</em>. She seems to be pretty overwhelmed despite being the favourite. And she just dropped the f-bomb with no bleep!</p>
<p><strong>01:58</strong> So the ads didn&#039;t hurt her chances...although WOW that&#039;s a high slit. Kirk Douglas certainly took his time to announce that...we were sort of dying inside by the time we found out the winner.</p>
<p><strong>01:57</strong> And the winner is Melissa Leo (<em>The Fighter</em>)!</p>
<p><strong>01:53</strong> Up next is the award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Here are the nominees: Amy Adams (<em>The Fighter</em>) Helena Bonham Carter (<em>The King&#039;s Speech</em>) Melissa Leo (<em>The Fighter</em>) Hailee Steinfeld (<em>True Grit</em>) Jacki Weaver (<em>Animal Kingdom</em>).</p>
<p><strong>01:52</strong> Kirk Douglas is up with a cane. He is such an adorable old man. His mind is still sharp as a tack.</p>
<p><strong>01:51</strong> Best supporting actress coming up soon: interesting to see if the controversy over Melissa Leo&#039;s bizarre <a href="http://thelmadams.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/mcx-melissa-leo-black-0211-split-lgn.jpg">adverts</a> - and the fact that she wouldn&#039;t stop talking about it - loses her the statue.</p>
<p><strong>01:48</strong> The Awards for Cinematography... nominees are <em>Black Swan</em>, <strong>Inception</strong>, <em>The King&#039;s Speech</em>, <em>The Social Network</em>, <em>True Grit</em>. Wally Pfister wins for <em>Inception</em>.</p>
<p><strong>01:48</strong> Once again, Roger Deakins is left empty-handed.</p>
<p><strong>01:46</strong> Winners saying half the award belongs to Tim Burton.</p>
<p><strong>01:45</strong> Award for Achievement in Art Direction... nominees: <em>Inception</em>, <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I</em>, <em>The King&#039;s Speech</em>, <strong>Alice in Winderland</strong>, <em>True Grit</em></p>
<p><strong>01:45</strong> Liking Tom Hanks&#039; specs. Specs is the right word for those.</p>
<p><strong>01:43</strong> Two-time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks is up to present the first two awards</p>
<p><strong>01:41</strong> Apparently it&#039;s been a great year for lesbians on film...tongue in cheek?</p>
<p><strong>01:41</strong> We&#039;ve been introduced to Anne&#039;s mum and James&#039;s grandma. Cute...but a little awkward.</p>
<p><strong>01:39</strong> Anne to James: &quot;You look very appealing to a younger demographic&quot; - mocking the fact that they were accused of being chosen as hosts to bring in a young audience.</p>
<p><strong>01:38</strong> Skit over - they&#039;re coming in, and Anne has changed her dress - kind of looks like what Nicole Kidman&#039;s should have.</p>
<p><strong>01:37</strong> Whoa...&#039;80s geek out alert: Back to the Future homage!</p>
<p><strong>01:36</strong> It&#039;s funny how Alec Baldwin in joke mode just sounds like Jack Donaghy.</p>
<p><strong>01:36</strong> Anne now dressed as the &#039;brown duck&#039;, in a Halloweeny type costume.</p>
<p><strong>01:35</strong> Morgan Freeman! Oh, we&#039;re at The King&#039;s Speech. Anne dressed as the Queen mum.</p>
<p><strong>01:34</strong> Now we&#039;ve reached True Grit...all you need to know is that they&#039;re very effectively mixing footage from the Oscar nominated movies with their own participation.</p>
<p><strong>01:34</strong> Now within a &#039;dream&#039; of Jesse Eisenberg&#039;s. Oh, reaching The Fighter dream level. This is kind of hard to explain.</p>
<p><strong>01:33</strong> Anne Hathaway and James Franco in their intro piece - with Leo DiCaprio doing an Inception parody. Nicely interspersed with real shots of the film. And we have a cameo from Alec Baldwin!</p>
<p><strong>01:31</strong> The ceremony is sort of starting, with a montage of this year&#039;s nominees to the Alton Towers music.</p>
<p><strong>01:31</strong> Worst dressed: Tying Cate Blanchett and Gwyneth Paltrow.</p>
<p><strong>01:30</strong> Our best dressed for the evening was probably last minute addition Natalie Portman.</p>
<p><strong>01:27</strong> Check out our <a href="../artsweek/6597.html">Oscar Predictions Videocast</a>, where we discuss all the nominees for the major categories.</p>
<p><strong>01:18</strong> We&#039;re all marvelling at Christian Bale&#039;s wandering accent. Apparently he&#039;s a Cockney now, it&#039;s quite a wonder to behold.</p>
<p><strong>01:16</strong> Debating our best and worst dressed. We&#039;ll let you know what we think in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>01:01</strong> We&#039;ve now switched to Sky Living coverage for the next half hour until the ceremony starts.</p>
<p><strong>00:59</strong> The very pregnant Natalie Portman is fashionably late in an off-the-shoulder plum draped number with some sequined detailing along the collar. It&#039;s Rodarte, and she&#039;s wearing Tiffany jewellery with lovely wavy hair.</p>
<p><strong>00:53</strong> E!&#039;s prediction poll for best actor: 35% for Colin, and a surprisingly high 25% for James Franco.</p>
<p><strong>00:50</strong> Anne Hathaway is here (in probably her first dress of the evening as the host) - another strapless red dress, but with an interestingly sculpted skirt. I think some of the other strapless reds will be more memorable.</p>
<p><strong>00:44</strong> From what we can see, Robert Downey Junior is looking very dapper, if a bit mafia-y, though we haven&#039;t seen the shoes yet. Love him so much.</p>
<p><strong>00:40</strong> Last year&#039;s Best Actress Sandra Bullock is here (yay!) in a bright red strapless Vera Wang. A great colour on her; she just always looks stunning.</p>
<p><strong>00:39</strong> Reese Witherspoon (a presenter later on) has arrived in a classy strapless flattering her hourglass figure - all black but for the white band around her chest.</p>
<p><strong>00:39</strong> Christian Bale says that he was &quot;happy&quot; to go the extra mile as regards losing a huge amount of weight for his character in <em>The Fighter</em>.</p>
<p><strong>00:35</strong> The rather remarkably average Gwyneth Paltrow has arrived in a sort of space suit dress, which is VERY similar to <a href="http://justjared.buzznet.com/photo-gallery/2515444/amy-adams-melissa-leo-sag-awards-07/">this Melissa Leo SAG awards dress</a>.</p>
<p><strong>00:32</strong> We finally get to look at Nicole Kidman&#039;s dress in full - white strapless with some sparkly detail on the front, but some odd overlapping material for the skirt makes her hips look huge (and that&#039;s saying something - she&#039;s tiny!) Very oddly shaped.</p>
<p><strong>00:31</strong> Penelope Cruz looks disgustingly good for someone who had a baby recently. Rocking the baby boobs in a slinky, strappy, sparkly red number that looks stunning.</p>
<p><strong>00:30</strong> We saw a glimpse of Halle Berry in a nude number - looks beautiful and neat for about 3/4 of the way down, and then the netting just becomes messy and looks like it was thrown together at the last minute.</p>
<p><strong>00:27</strong> Christian Bale&#039;s arrived, unfortunately with beard. Don&#039;t fight the hotness, Christian!</p>
<p><strong>00:25</strong> Celine Dion&#039;s here! (Why? Performing the In Memoriam song). Clean white plunging neckline with full-length sleeves. Very age-appropriate yet still sexy.</p>
<p><strong>00:23</strong> Really hope we get to see Colin Firth&#039;s wife Livia properly: all her red-carpet dresses are eco-friendly, check out her &quot;Green Carpet challenge&quot; blog for Vogue <a href="http://www.vogue.co.uk/blogs/livia-firth/">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>00:22</strong> Hilary Swank in a bejewelled strapless gown with white and grey feathery wisps towards the hem. A little OTT, but the Oscars is probably the only venue where it works perfectly. Nice job!</p>
<p><strong>00:20</strong> Helena Bonham Carter bringing our much needed dose of crazy! Black velvet dress with a corset, and the sleeves sort of look like they&#039;ve been attacked by wolves. There&#039;s a bit of a bustle in the back too - bringing &quot;1880s style&quot; according to her.</p>
<p><strong>00:13</strong> Justin Timberlake&#039;s mum in a teal dress. Not wearing a bra (=saggy). #ChestSupportFail.</p>
<p><strong>00:12</strong> Busy Phillips has arrived as Michelle Williams&#039; date, and is surprisingly one of the best dressed! Lovely, solid black, strapless mermaid gown - it&#039;s just flawless.</p>
<p><strong>00:09</strong> Sharon Stone with a bouffant hairstyle (clearly a bump-it going on there) in a one-shoulder black gown with, what I&#039;d say, is just a tad too many feathers on the shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>00:08</strong> Apparently there&#039;ll be a musical <em>Twilight</em> moment during the show - none of us here particularly care.</p>
<p><strong>00:03</strong> Scarlett Johannsson in a D&amp;G maroon dress, with some floral print all along it. Has a bare back, which breaks up the otherwise quite covered up look.</p>
<p><strong>00:02</strong> Not sure about Marisa Tomei&#039;s dress: very exaggerated mermaid, bit bizarre looking, to be honest. Her hair is cute, though, and the fact that she&#039;s 46 is still unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>00:00</strong> Jeremy Renner says that <em>Mission Impossible 4</em> has &quot;gone great&quot; and that he&#039;s looking forward to Joss Whedon&#039;s <em>The Avengers</em>.</p>
<p><strong>23:59</strong> For anyone wondering, we are watching  E!&#039;s red carpet coverage on Sky channel 151. There&#039;s also coverage on Sky Living.</p>
<p><strong>23:57</strong> E!&#039;s prediction poll for Best Actress - a whopping 81% for Natalie Portman!</p>
<p><strong>23:56</strong> Just seen Cate Blanchett...eep. Another lavender number from firm-looking material, but with some bizarre yellow detail around the collar and back that do not go AT ALL. A perfect circle is cut out from the chest to reveal some plain material. Don&#039;t know what she was thinking.</p>
<p><strong>23:55</strong> Geoffrey Rush talking about how <em>The King&#039;s Speech</em> &quot;fell into place in a rather beautiful way&quot; and how he didn&#039;t expect a film about two middle-aged men to have much appeal.</p>
<p><strong>23:53</strong> Jennifer Hudson in a bright red halterneck gown with a fantastic sculpted skirt; plunging neckline with just the right amount of cleavage. She will have heads turning for sure!</p>
<p><strong>23:52</strong> Jesse Eisenberg has arrived - just being escorted by security onto the red carpet.</p>
<p><strong>23:50</strong> Currently they&#039;re just recapping what we&#039;ve seen so far. Bear with us!</p>
<p><strong>23:43</strong> Zachary Levi of <em>Chuck</em> and <em>Tangled</em> is as charming as ever. He&#039;ll be performing with <em>Tangled</em> co-star Mandy Moore during the Awards ceremony.</p>
<p><strong>23:40</strong> Amy Adams up this time. Wearing a navy blue floor-length sparkler; very conservative but figure-hugging.</p>
<p><strong>23:40</strong> Amy Adams says that it wasn&#039;t difficult to find the &quot;feistiness&quot; for her role in <em>The Fighter</em>.</p>
<p><strong>23:35</strong> E!&#039;s prediction poll (voted by the public) says Amy Adams will win best supporting actress (26%) with Melissa Leo at a close second with 25%.</p>
<p><strong>23:34</strong> Michelle Williams&#039; dress is fine, but it&#039;s very reminiscent of <a href="http://tomandlorenzo2.blogspot.com/2010/09/in-or-out-michelle-willians-in-jason-wu.html">this dress</a> that she wore to the Venice Film festival, only a slightly different colour and minus the bow. It&#039;s nice though, just very expected.</p>
<p><strong>23:33</strong> Russell Brand just introduced Ryan Seacrest to his mum, Babs.</p>
<p><strong>23:32</strong> Mandy Moore in a nude sparkly Monique Lhullier; a more demure quiet version of Olivia Wilde&#039;s Golden Globes dress.</p>
<p><strong>23:28</strong> Mila Kunis says that she first met Darren Aronofsky for her role in <em>Black Swan</em> over iChat!</p>
<p><strong>23:28</strong> Just seen Mila Kunis in full...YIKES. We all screamed in horror. A lavender wispy creation (by Elie Saab) with way too much excessive lacey material. Her top half looks like it should have stayed in the bedroom. Easily her worst after her stunning efforts at the Golden Globes and SAG awards.</p>
<p><strong>23:26</strong> Florence from &#039;Florence and the Machine&#039; is looking a little matronly and covered up, once again in nude.</p>
<p><strong>23:25</strong> Hailee Steinfeld is, as always, ridiculously grown-up and lovely - she&#039;s already got the whole &quot;I&#039;m just happy to be nominated!&quot; thing down, and her reaction to the message from the blimp was adorable.</p>
<p><strong>23:24</strong> Hailee Steinfeld has arrived in a nude gown - a little more red-carpety than her previous edgy youthful ventures, but I like this fashion side of her! Quite modest and yet elegant. Apparently she helped design it - it&#039;s a one-of-a-kind Marchesa she drew out.</p>
<p><strong>23:17</strong> Armie Hammer is (<em>The Social Network</em>) on screen now. Talking about his experience in being cast for the movie after they couldn&#039;t find &#039;Ivy League&#039; twins. Describing David Fincher (his director) as &quot;voraciously intelligent&quot; and an &quot;emperor&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>23:16</strong> James Franco remarks that Ricky Gervais (who suggested an opening for Franco and Anne Hathaway as Oscar hosts) already did an awards show and he &quot;bombed.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>23:14</strong> We&#039;ve glimpsed a preview of Mila Kunis. We&#039;re going to be on edge all evening in case she pulls a Judy Finnigan.</p>
<p><strong>23:13</strong> And we&#039;re back! Melissa Leo has a slim tinfoil-esque dress with a doily-like white overlay. Better fitting than her Golden Globes dress, but still not entirely won over.</p>
<p><strong>23:09</strong> We caught a brief glimpse of Melissa Leo before the ad break in a high collar white jacket; not sure yet how we feel, but we&#039;ll see it fully soon!</p>
<p><strong>23:08</strong> Also at the Razzies, Ashton Kutcher was given the award for Worst Actor for his performances in <em>Killers</em> and <em>Valentine&rsquo;s Day</em>.</p>
<p><strong>23:08</strong> Josh Hutcherson (a.k.a. Laser from <em>The Kids Are All Right</em>); he&#039;s saying he&#039;s a huge fan of Christian Bale and looks up to him.</p>
<p><strong>23:07</strong> The actresses of <em>Sex and the City 2</em> shared the Worst Actress Award and the Worst Ensemble Cast Award. (The film also walked away with the award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel)</p>
<p><strong>23:06</strong> <em>The Last Airbender</em> was the big &ldquo;winner&rdquo; at last night&rsquo;s Golden Raspberry Awards - picking up the awards for Worst Picture, Director, Screenplay, and Supporting Actor, as well as &ldquo;Worst Eye-Gouging Misuse of 3-D.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>23:04</strong> Liking Jennifer Lawrence&#039;s simple but pretty red dress with a scoop neck. Good hair and make-up. Simon thinks it&#039;s nice.</p>
<p><strong>23:01</strong> Hi guys, and welcome to our Oscars liveblog! We&#039;ll be tracking every moment of the red carpet and ceremony right here at <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>.</p>
