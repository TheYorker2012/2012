		<div class="SubText">The Yorker asks three of York&#039;s finest students to give us their opinion on, for some, the most anticipated movie EVER: Sex and the City.</div>

        

<h3> <strong>Female perspective</strong> </h3>

<p><strong>Abigail Fenton - Second Year Literature Student</strong></p>
<p>For some the most anticipated film of the year, for others the most scorned; <em>Sex and the City: The Movie</em> has divided the nation. In it, Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda and Samantha return, with their men, four years after we last saw them, bringing us weddings, break-ups, reunions and more &ndash; and, of course, they do it all in fabulous outfits, thanks to the sartorial expertise of Patricia Fielding.</p>
<p>I&#039;ll be honest: it&#039;s not the greatest film in the world. The plot is sometimes thin, the ending is pretty predictable, and the dialogue isn&#039;t always quite snappy enough. Interspersed with some genuinely touching moments is the odd moment which seems completely incongruent with both the show and the characters we have seen developing over six seasons, added in just to get a cheap laugh &ndash; Charlotte&#039;s &#039;Poughkeepsie pants&#039; spring to mind.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<img src="../../images/prototype/news/quote_open.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
We laughed together, we gasped together, we shed a tear together.
<img src="../../images/prototype/news/quote_close.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
<br /><span class="author">Abigail Fenton</span>
</div></blockquote><p>But this film is designed for the legions of fans of Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda and Samantha who will love it. The infrequent watcher is provided for with a recap in the opening credits to get them up to speed, and, surrounded by the kind of diehard fans who will clap and cheer the title screen and gasp with indignation at the appropriate times, will find it impossible not to join them laughing, crying, commiserating, and celebrating along with the characters.</p>
<p>Watching the film in its first few days of release, I was joined by some of the most enthusiastic of fans, and it felt like the biggest female-bonding exercise I&#039;ve ever known; we laughed together, we gasped together, we shed a tear together. If you like <em>Sex and the City</em>, even only a little bit, it&#039;s well worth going to see this film &ndash; and go quickly, while there is still enough excitement about it to fill a cinema: the atmosphere is not to be missed.</p>


<h3>Gay perspective</h3>

<p><strong>Martin Mulligan - First Year Management Student</strong></p>
<p>Being an avid fan of the series <em>Sex and the City</em>, going to watch the film was a brilliant experience. The series itself left a lot of things unresolved for the characters, and left fans who had been dedicated to the series for six years of their lives with a burning curiosity to see what happens next.</p>
<p>The film itself in my opinion showed that even though all these women had found &#039;the one&#039;, there will always be obstacles to conquer, no matter how perfect a relationship seems to be.</p>
<p>After the film, my friend and I walked back to campus, and discussed the emotional rollercoaster the film had taken us on, as well as past relationships, our regrets and our hopes that one day we would find &#039;the one&#039;. However one might say that the film and series does centre things a lot around relationships, and seems to say that in order to be happy you need to have one.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<img src="../../images/prototype/news/quote_open.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
Isn&#039;t there more to life then simply seeking &#039;the one&#039;? The film didn&#039;t show any.
<img src="../../images/prototype/news/quote_close.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
<br /><span class="author">Martin Mulligan</span>
</div></blockquote><p>My friend and I came to the conclusion that before seeing the film, this had never been the case for us, because we are at a great university, have met amazing people and know that this experience will be beneficial to us in the long term. The film does make you question whether or not your marital status is making you happy, but that&#039;s all it asks you. Isn&#039;t there more to life then simply seeking &#039;the one&#039;? The film didn&#039;t show any.</p>
<p>What disappointed me most was the fact that Carrie went back to Big, a man that had messed her around for over ten years. It almost suggested that at 40, she had to make do with what was left on the singles market. Overall though the film was really entertaining, but I think a lot of fans wanted more than to be entertained, but be inspired, which they weren&#039;t.</p>


<h3> Male perspective </h3>

<p><strong>Sam Turner - Third Year Politics and Sociology student</strong></p>
<p>The film maintains its faux philosophical moments which are far from pearls of wisdom. For the first part of the film the characters seem uneasy in their roles and the script writing fails to capture the same essence as the series.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<img src="../../images/prototype/news/quote_open.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
Let your girlfriend take her girlfriends.
<img src="../../images/prototype/news/quote_close.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
<br /><span class="author">Sam Turner</span>
</div></blockquote><p>The humour was directed at a mixture of middle aged women and young teenage girls. Charlotte&#039;s shitting herself scene was painful to watch, its slap-stick qualities do not have a place in this movie.</p>
<p>It&#039;s even less fun watching these ladies having sex now that they&#039;re so old. So unless you&#039;re into fashion, let your girlfriend take her girlfriends, as this sentimental wishy washy film is only invaluable for <em>Sex and the City</em> fans.</p>

<p>...I&#039;m not the most politically correct person in the world but I think there&#039;s something seriously wrong with this article.</p>
<p>You&#039;ve got a straight man, a straight woman and a gay man to each do a review, but the content of their reviews has nothing whatsoever to do with their &#039;perspective&#039;. This just seems to imply that there&#039;s a lesbian perpective, a bi perspective, trans gender perspective and so on. I&#039;m not saying that you should have found reviews from every group going, just that this way of reviewing this film is horrifically clumsy and very offensive to any fans that aren&#039;t &#039;gay&#039; or &#039;female&#039;.</p>
<p>Perhaps better categories would have been &#039;fans of the series&#039; vs &#039;never seen the series&#039; - that&#039;s more what the content of the article actually reflects.</p>

<p>Indeed. Although I wasn&#039;t quite sure if &quot;camp&quot; meant &quot;gay&quot;, it is quite a loaded term.</p>

<p>George, you clearly ARE the most politically correct person in the world and i think you&#039;ve interpreted this all very cynically. Its unfortunate that you chose to see things this way.</p>

<ul id="CommentItem3623History" class="comment_edit"><li>Mon, 9th Jun 2008 1:52am - Edited by the author</li></ul><p>You&#039;ve got a straight man, a straight woman and a gay man to each do a review, but the content of their reviews has nothing whatsoever to do with their &#039;perspective&#039;.</p>
<p>Oh come on, did you read the artice? What a ridiculous thing to say. The show is unashamedly marketed at women and effeminate gay men; to suggest otherwise would be completely naive. It seems to me that women and men into fashion (which, if we&#039;re not going to tip-toe here, are normally camp gay men) will probably like it more than straight men.  This isn&#039;t a revolutionary or provocative assertion surely? Is that not why this article is like that? maybe i&#039;m missing something...</p>
<p>It doesn&#039;t seem to have anything to do with whether or not someone&#039;s seen the series...in fact, is it even suggested that the straight male hasn&#039;t? &#039;It&#039;s even less fun watching these ladies having sex now that they&#039;re so old.&#039;?</p>
<p>The only problem I see is that the gay perspective seems to be synonymous with an effeminate gay male perspective; not all homosexual men are. Camp could be a bit loaded though I guess...</p>
<p>Anyway, no-one&#039;s seems to be homophobic and no-one seems to be left out (who said the female perspective was straight?)</p>
<p>Great reviews, well written!</p>

<p>oh the wonders of anonymity...</p>
<p>&quot;Gay perspective<br />
Martin Mulligan - First Year Management Student</p>
<p>Being an avid fan of the series&quot;</p>
<p>His first line, if what you&#039;ve said is right, should have been - &#039;being a gay man...&#039; NOT &#039;Being an avid fan&#039; Do you see what I mean?</p>
<p>&quot;Male perspective<br />
Sam Turner - Third Year Politics and Sociology student</p>
<p>The film maintains its faux philosophical moments...&quot;</p>
<p>Again, if what you&#039;ve said is right this should have read, &#039;being a man, I think blah blah&#039;, instead what we are treated to is his opinion (not right or wrong it&#039;s a review, I&#039;ve no issues with what he&#039;s saying), but his opinion is not from his being a man, but from a clearly ingrained dislike of the series.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Abigail Fenton&#039;s &#039;Female view&#039; is remarkably neutral, and you only get a hint of what it&#039;s like to view the film as a woman in her closing lines.</p>
<p>My point is that the structure of the article is just so clumsy, and the content doesn&#039;t match what it is trying to achieve - resulting in something which is quite offensive!</p>

<ul id="CommentItem3630History" class="comment_edit"><li>Mon, 9th Jun 2008 12:10pm - Edited by the author</li></ul><p>What absolute rubbish George Taylor. I don&#039;t think for a second Martin would have been unaware that his perspective would be titled as it was. His perspective was from a self-acknowledged &#039;gay&#039; perspective. He didn&#039;t need to explicitly say it as I&#039;m sure that he was aware of the premise of the article to begin with. Same goes for the male perspective I would suggest.</p>
<p>It&#039;s not clumsy, you&#039;re just being overly cynical and taking the review entirely out of context. It&#039;s clearly taking the widely acknowledged market audience of the show and then offering a different (and yes, slightly obvious) male opinion as a contrastive element.</p>
<p>his opinion is not from his being a man, but from a clearly ingrained dislike of the series.</p>
<p>Bit chicken and egg there isn&#039;t it...maybe he dislikes the series because he&#039;s a man; he doesn&#039;t enjoy the female fashion that the show is somewhat based upon. I think that would be a widely accepted opinion to the less, well...touchy, among us.</p>
<p>I think the last few lines are pretty conclusive that she was definitely writing from a female perspective so that argument&#039;s pretty ridiculous.</p>
<p>I know it&#039;s nice to take the high moralistic horse sometimes but for god&#039;s sake, take some things in the spirit in which they were intended.</p>

<p>I don&#039;t really want to be dragged into a pointless internet argument with anonymous posters so I&#039;m not going to keep arguing my point of view, what I believe is what I have said - it&#039;s there to agree or disagree with, that&#039;s up to you.

<ul id="CommentItem3637History" class="comment_edit"><li>Mon, 9th Jun 2008 3:29pm - Edited by the author</li></ul><p>I generally like the approach this article takes, having a film reviewed from different perspectives is a refreshing approach.</p>
<p>However i do take issue with number 4&#039;s argumnet</p>
<p>&quot;Anyway, no-one&#039;s seems to be homophobic and no-one seems to be left out (who said the female perspective was straight?)&quot;</p>
<p>I agree that no one said that the female perspective was straight, but then why is the distinction made between gay male and straight male?</p>
<p>In my student house last year the biggest fan of SATC happened to be a lesbian, so the show does not only appeal to straight females and camp men. I think that if the distinction between gay and straight male is being made then the distinction between gay and straight female should be made . Quite clearly there are opinions left out. Obviously its ridiculous to ask for every sexuality to be equally represented in a short review like this, but pointing out ways the review could have encompassed a wider perspective  is not a bad thing and people should not be criticised for doing so.</p>

<p>George, come on...</p>
<p>&quot;you only get a hint of what it&#039;s like to view the film as a woman in her closing lines&quot;</p>
<p>I think the final conclusive lines in any &#039;piece&#039; tend to sum up the tone in general. That line seems to be so representative that it speaks for itself in terms of whether the female perspective, and the rest of the differing views for that matter, should be taken as such. Inane comments? I don&#039;t think I even need to state the obvious there...</p>
<p>&quot;a pointless internet argument&quot;</p>
<p>well it&#039;s good to know that your accusations of horrific clumsiness and general offense to large sectors of society are taken seriously.</p>

<p>Isn&#039;t the assertion that women generally like the show, no discrimination on sexuality? I think this would be perfectly reasonable to suggest which is probably why the female perspective isn&#039;t divided as such? I don&#039;t think anyone suggested that gay women wouldn&#039;t like the show.</p>
<p>However, it seems to be generally accepted that gay men and straight men will on the whole differ on their opinions due to the show&#039;s content. Not entirely obviously but pc issues aside, this will generally be the case.</p>
<p>S&#039;all got a bit silly hasn&#039;t it...</p>

<p>HAHA. Having lived with Sam for a year now I can assure you that his &#039;dislike&#039; for SATC did not manifest itself on any of the many occasions that I&#039;ve walked into the living room and found him watching it - alone, quite the opposite.<br />
Sam Turner, it&#039;s about time we faced facts: you love Carrie and the rest of her annoying crew, you&#039;re just too &quot;manly&quot; to admit it <img src="../../images/smileys/grin.gif" alt="" /></p>
