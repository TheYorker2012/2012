        <p><strong>05:10</strong> Well, that&#039;s all dudes. We hope you enjoyed the show - we certainly had a lot of fun. Now, with stomachs full of 5-layer dip, cookies and chocolate cornflake cakes, we head to bed for our lectures tomorrow...boo reality!</p>
<p><strong>05:02</strong> This is amazing! They didn&#039;t side with Golden Globes over BAFTA. Thank you The Academy of Motion Arts Sciences you have done yourselves proud and given us all faith in you that would have otherwise been irreperabley broken!!!</p>
<p><strong>05:01</strong> Wow that was fast...the winner for Best Picture, announced almost immediately, is THE HURT LOCKER!!!</p>
<p><strong>05:00</strong> Tom Hanks has just stepped out and he is announcing Best Picture.</p>
<p><strong>05:00</strong> We&#039;re on the final stretch folks. Best Picture only award left.</p>
<p><strong>04:59</strong> Kathryn Bigelow stands as the first woman to win Best Director. Once again the Oscars are going with the Directors Guild award and breaking with the tradition of siding with the Golden Globes over Bafta in the last 20 years. Could this be the year they do it twice for Best Picture???</p>
<p><strong>04:57</strong> &quot;Well, the time has come&quot; - what Barbra Streisand said before she announced the winner. Do we think she was biased?</p>
<p><strong>04:57</strong> THE WINNER IS KATHRYN BIGELOW!!!</p>
<p><strong>04:56</strong> Kathryn Bigelow rhymes with gigilo... are Peter and Nat alone in thinking this everytime they hear her name???</p>
<p><strong>04:55</strong> Barbra Streisand out to present Best Director.</p>
<p><strong>04:54</strong> Also just gave a shout-out to all mothers of adopted children. She&#039;s seriously crying now talking about her own mother and her own upbringing. Bless her, this obviously means the world to her.</p>
<p><strong>04:54</strong> Hannah&#039;s 0-2 on her bets. The bookies are richer.</p>
<p><strong>04:52</strong> First ever to win an Oscar and a Razzie in the same year.
&quot;Did I really earn this or did I just wear you all down?&quot; That&#039;s probably pretty accurate actually. She&#039;s using her Oscar speech time to praise all the other nominees individually - very classy. Also, just referenced her weird kiss with Meryl Streep - &quot;you&#039;re such a good kisser!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>04:50</strong> And the winner is...Sandra Bullock!</p>
<p><strong>04:50</strong> That was a really odd introduction from Sean Penn.... he talked about neglecting to honour an actress twice.</p>
<p><strong>04:49</strong> And now Sean Penn out to present Best Actress.</p>
<p><strong>04:48</strong> Aw, Peter Sarsgaard told Carey Mulligan to get used to being honoured &quot;darling&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>04:47</strong> The epitome of success according to Oprah: being nominated in the same category as Meryl Streep. No joke.</p>
<p><strong>04:46</strong> And they&#039;re at it again with the co-stars and &#039;friends&#039;, this time for Best Actress: Forest Whitaker, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Sheen (so that&#039;s what he&#039;s doing there), Peter Sarsgaard and Stanley Tucci.</p>
<p><strong>04:38</strong> Apparently, we&#039;re getting the nominees for &#039;Best Pitcher&#039;. Funny dialects.</p>
<p><strong>04:37</strong> Doing a shout-out to the director. Believe it or not, this is his 5th (!) nomination and only win. His first nomination was in 1971 - that&#039;s nearly 40 years to win an Oscar. Definitely well-deserved for an outstanding career.</p>
<p><strong>04:35</strong> Jeff Bridges shouts: &quot;Yeah, mom and dad!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>04:35</strong> Hannah&#039;s now poorer after the money she bet on Colin Firth winning.</p>
<p><strong>04:34</strong> And the winner is... Jeff Bridges.</p>
<p><strong>04:33</strong> Kate Winslet now presenting Best Actor.</p>
<p><strong>04:33</strong> Colin Farrell paying tribute to Jeremy Renner: Apparently they took a trip to Mexico where they were only &quot;spooning&quot; while they shared a bed.</p>
<p><strong>04:30</strong> Tim Robbins looks so old! In my mind he&#039;ll forever be Shawshank age.</p>
<p><strong>04:28</strong> Random co-stars past and present of the actors nominated for Best Actor are standing on stage to give tribute to them - Michelle Pfeiffer, Colin Farrell, Tim Robbins, Julianne Moore and Vera Farmiga.</p>
<p><strong>04:20</strong> Kathy Bates presenting Avatar as a Best Picture nominee. Huh?</p>
<p><strong>04:20</strong> The guy accepting the award valiantly carries on over the music playing him off. Go him.</p>
<p><strong>04:18</strong> And the winner is... &#039;The Secret of Your Eyes&#039; from Argentina. Wow, upset for &#039;The White Ribbon&#039; and &#039;A Prophet&#039;.</p>
<p><strong>04:16</strong> Pedro Almodovar and Quentin Tarantino presenting Best Foreign Language Film.</p>
<p><strong>04:10</strong> Keanu Reeves introducing &#039;The Hurt Locker&#039; as a Best Picture nominee. RANDOM.</p>
<p><strong>04:09</strong> And the winner is... &#039;The Hurt Locker&#039;. 4 out of 9 so far.</p>
<p><strong>04:09</strong> Best Introduction of the night - so far the leaders are Robert Downey Jr. &amp; Tina Fey, Ben Stiller and Tyler Perry.</p>
<p><strong>04:08</strong> YES the snuggie!</p>
<p><strong>04:07</strong> Tyler Perry onstage to present Best Editing. Bless, he&#039;s so pleased they said his name at the Oscars.</p>
<p><strong>04:06</strong> I always watch the short presenting bits for Documentaries and say how interesting they look, and then I never watch them - Nat</p>
<p><strong>04:05</strong> And the winner is...&#039;The Cove&#039;</p>
<p><strong>04:03</strong> Matt Damon presenting Best Documentary.</p>
<p><strong>03:58</strong> Jason Bateman introducing &#039;Up in the Air&#039; as a Best Picture nominee.</p>
<p><strong>03:56</strong> And the winner is... &#039;Avatar&#039;.</p>
<p><strong>03:56</strong> Gerard Butler and Bradley Cooper presenting Best Visual Effects. Has to be &#039;Avatar&#039;, otherwise there is no justice.</p>
<p><strong>03:55</strong> Aw, his acceptance speech was good - telling all the kids out there that their creative endeavours are not a waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>03:53</strong> And the winner is... &#039;Up&#039;! Yay! 2nd win of the night.</p>
<p><strong>03:53</strong> Best faces of the night: George Clooney</p>
<p><strong>03:52</strong> We&#039;re betting on the &#039;Up&#039; score, not only because it was amazing, but because they&#039;ve done the best dance to it so far.</p>
<p><strong>03:49</strong> Some members of the group aren&#039;t happy at the robot dance being done to the score from The Hurt Locker.</p>
<p><strong>03:48</strong> They&#039;re showcasing the best scores with dance. Quite good I suppose, but then I don&#039;t know anything about dance - Hannah</p>
<p><strong>03:47</strong> Sam Worthington and Jennifer Lopez are presenting Best Original Score. Sam Worthington has some slick moves with his spectacles.</p>
<p><strong>03:44</strong> I still can&#039;t believe Natasha Richardson was this year. Seems like so long ago - Peter</p>
<p><strong>03:43</strong> So many people lost last year - you don&#039;t realise it until you see them all in front of you in the space of two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>03:41</strong> This music is actually making me tear up. Very tastefully done.</p>
<p><strong>03:40</strong> Demi is here to start off the &#039;In Memorium&#039; segment with James Taylor accompanying on guitar.</p>
<p><strong>03:38</strong> Demi Moore has opted for frills. When will people realise they&#039;re never flattering?</p>
<p><strong>03:37</strong> The winner is... Avatar. Makes sense, but the applause is fairly muted. Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>03:36</strong> Sandra Bullock (looking very nervous) is up to present the Cinematography advert.</p>
<p><strong>03:32</strong> Quentin Tarantino doing some good old-fashioned fist-pumping bigging up himself. &quot;IF I&#039;M NOT GOING TO WIN, I&#039;M GOING TO MILK THIS!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>03:31</strong> John Travolta is on stage talking about Inglorious Basterds. Just because you change the spelling doesn&#039;t make it more socially acceptable. English Language corrupters take note!!!</p>
<p><strong>03:29</strong> Elizabeth Banks on stage with her Valkyries dress. Oh, dig at James Cameron, snap!</p>
<p><strong>03:28</strong> The winner is... The Hurt Locker. 3rd Win! Same twitchy big haired man is back on stage</p>
<p><strong>03:27</strong> And now time for Best Sound Mixing.</p>
<p><strong>03:27</strong> Great mane of Scandinavian hair though.</p>
<p><strong>03:26</strong> wow... the winner is a bit twitchy</p>
<p><strong>03:26</strong> The Winner Is... The Hurt Locker. 2nd Award of the night!!!</p>
<p><strong>03:24</strong> Anna Kendrick and Zac Efron are up now presenting Best Sound Editing with Morgan Freeman narrating. LEGENDARY!!</p>
<p><strong>03:23</strong> Actually, this montage is pretty cool. Although some of these films being horror films is debatable. &#039;New Moon&#039; for example is NOT a horror film, so why is it in the montage?</p>
<p><strong>03:20</strong> Taylor Lautner and Kristen Stewart are actually presenting the Horror Tribute... as if their acting wasn&#039;t scary enough (last dig at them we promise)</p>
<p><strong>03:19</strong> Alec Balswin and Steve Martin parodying &#039;Paranormal Activity&#039;. Awww they&#039;re in the same bed an&#039; everything.</p>
<p><strong>03:16</strong> Seriously, why do they let that bint leave the house - Peter</p>
<p><strong>03:15</strong> I think we&#039;re predicting a three-way vom-fest when Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner appear on screen.</p>
<p><strong>03:14</strong> (Also, that acceptance speech for Best Costume Design was WEIRD! So ungenuine and the the sorta speech you can make when you&#039;ve won two before)</p>
<p><strong>03:13</strong> Charlize Theron introducing &#039;Precious&#039; as a Best Picture nominee.</p>
<p><strong>03:12</strong> Michael Sheen is in the audience with his quiff because.... he&#039;s in &#039;Underworld 3&#039;?</p>
<p><strong>03:11</strong> And the winner is... &#039;The Young Victoria&#039;</p>
<p><strong>03:11</strong> Tom Ford and Sarah Jessica Parker onstage to present Best Costume Design. We&#039;re thinking either &#039;The Young Victoria&#039; or &#039;Coco Before Chanel&#039;</p>
<p><strong>03:09</strong> Oh no, they just called James Cameron a genius. Ew. Can you tell we&#039;re a bit biased?</p>
<p><strong>03:09</strong> Oh god, cheesy Avatar speech. Peter just threw up a little.</p>
<p><strong>03:08</strong> Everytime Nat sees James Cameron&#039;s face, she thinks he&#039;s a &quot;douche&quot;. Couldn&#039;t agree more?</p>
<p><strong>03:08</strong> And the winner is... &#039;Avatar&#039;. WHAT.</p>
<p><strong>03:07</strong> Sigourney Weaver on stage to present Best Art Direction.</p>
<p><strong>03:05</strong> Ok a glamorous perfume ad just turned into a message about cervical cancer. That was unexpected.</p>
<p><strong>03:04</strong> Coming up: A salute to Horror Films. Now that&#039;s gonna be &quot;interesting&quot;</p>
<p><strong>03:02</strong> Colin Firth presenting &#039;An Education&#039; as a nominee for Best Picture. Appropriate, non?</p>
<p><strong>03:02</strong> Mo&#039;Nique sounds so impassioned. On the verge of tears, but a wonderfully touching speech.</p>
<p><strong>03:01</strong> Totally deserved, if you ask the room. Even those 30 seconds of her on screen had me choked up.</p>
<p><strong>03:00</strong> And the winner is...Mo&#039;nique!</p>
<p><strong>02:57</strong> Penelope Cruz has her hand on Javier Bardem&#039;s thigh. Gossip? Lucky girl.</p>
<p><strong>02:56</strong> Robin Williams presenting Best Supporting Actress, more serious than usual I feel.</p>
<p><strong>02:55</strong> Lauren Bacall and Roger Corman, Honorary Award recipients at the Governor&#039;s Award, are standing up and waving. Ooh they&#039;re getting a standing ovation.</p>
<p><strong>02:54</strong> Oh, it&#039;s the highlights of the Governor&#039;s Award. Whatever that is.</p>
<p><strong>02:53</strong> Queen Latifah is presenting... we&#039;re not sure. But we like her.</p>
<p><strong>02:51</strong> Geoffrey Fletcher, screenwriter for Precious, is getting emotional.</p>
<p><strong>02:51</strong> And the winner is.... Precious. First shock of the night?</p>
<p><strong>02:48</strong> Rachel McAdams and Jake Gyllenhaal presenting Best Adapted Screenplay.</p>
<p><strong>02:44</strong> Jeff Bridges introducing &#039;A Serious Man&#039; as a Best Picture nominee.</p>
<p><strong>02:42</strong> The Winner is... STAR TREK. Hannah is not amused :D</p>
<p><strong>02:42</strong> Ben Stiller struggling with his Na&#039;vi tail. Prolonging the tension. Joker.</p>
<p><strong>02:41</strong> Hannah wondering why Star Trek was nominated: &quot;All they did was the ears!&quot; Yes, and the dozens of other aliens.</p>
<p><strong>02:40</strong> Presenting the award for Best Make-Up. &quot;Ironically, Avatar isn&#039;t even nominated.&quot; James Cameron is straining to look amused. But this is the funniest presenting speech of the night!</p>
<p><strong>02:39</strong> Ben Stiller is on stage dressed as a Na&#039;vi. This is AMAZING!!! Who cares what he is presenting!</p>
<p><strong>02:37</strong> Shame, we wanted the one with the awesome name to win - &#039;Miracle Fish&#039;.</p>
<p><strong>02:37</strong> And the winner is...The New Tenants.</p>
<p><strong>02:36</strong> And now Best Live Action Short (wow a lot of stagetime for Zoe and Carey)</p>
<p><strong>02:36</strong> First playing-off of the evening for winner of Best Documentary. Brutal.</p>
<p><strong>02:35</strong> And the winner is.... Music By Prudence. He was halfway down the aisle. Presumptive much?</p>
<p><strong>02:34</strong> Right, now time for the award for Best Documentary Short</p>
<p><strong>02:33</strong> Logorama took 6 years to make, wow gotta love the dedication</p>
<p><strong>02:33</strong> From the few seconds of glimpses we got, Logorama looked totally cool (a cartoon made entirely out of logos).</p>
<p><strong>02:32</strong> The winner of Best Animated Short is Logorama. Bad luck Nick Park.</p>
<p><strong>02:31</strong> &#039;You know the thing I like about short films? They&#039;re short&#039; - John Lasseter *slow claps*</p>
<p><strong>02:29</strong> Carey Mulligan and Zoe Saldana presenting award for Best Animated Short Film.</p>
<p><strong>02:27</strong> Check out the reclining leather sofas! We&#039;re probably more comfortable than the celebs at the Kodak Theatre.</p>
<p><strong>02:25</strong> Samuel L. Jackson now introducing &#039;Up&#039; as a Best Picture nominee.</p>
<p><strong>02:24</strong> You gotta love Kristen Stewart looking like she has no idea who they were just talking about.</p>
<p><strong>02:23</strong> Wow, big John Hughes cast reunion on stage. This really has been a year of great loss in the industry. I wonder which 30 will make the cut for the later &#039;In Memorium&#039; section</p>
<p><strong>02:20</strong> Charming montage of his films interspersed with interviews with him. Ah, Home Alone...classic!</p>
<p><strong>02:18</strong> Now Molly Ringwald and Matthew Broderick are presenting a tribute to John Hughes, director of &#039;The Breakfast Club&#039;, who passed away last year.</p>
<p><strong>02:17</strong> Mark Boal honouring Kathryn Bigelow, and dedicating the award to the troops. Very appropriate and genuine.</p>
<p><strong>02:16</strong> The first Hurt Locker win of the night...is this the beginning of a sweep?</p>
<p><strong>02:16</strong> And the winner is...The Hurt Locker.</p>
<p><strong>02:14</strong> Nominees for Best Original Screenplay being announced.</p>
<p><strong>02:14</strong> Tina Fey and Robert Downey Jr. - awesome combination. Best introduction of the night so far.</p>
<p><strong>02:13</strong> Is SJP chewing gum? Tacky.</p>
<p><strong>02:13</strong> Robery Downey Jr. wearing a fetching combination of blue bow tie and blue shades.</p>
<p><strong>02:12</strong> Alec Baldwin: &quot;Welcome back to the Oscars, the biggest night in Hollywood since last night&quot;. That was the Razzies. Ha.</p>
<p><strong>02:12</strong> Alec Baldwin credits Tina Fey with reviving his career. True dat.</p>
<p><strong>02:10</strong> The dip is almost finished... all that&#039;s left if the refried beans and some random cheese fragments</p>
<p><strong>02:07</strong> Seriously, way too many breaks. And Diet Coke is apparently extroadinary. &#039;The more you know&#039; eh?</p>
<p><strong>02:06</strong> Chris Pine now is introducing &#039;District 9&#039; as a Best Picture nominee.</p>
<p><strong>02:05</strong> Following in the Golden Globe footsteps. Whoa, T-Bone Burnett is actually accepting his Oscar with sunglasses. He&#039;s too cool. And he didn&#039;t say a word...only Ryan Bingham spoke.</p>
<p><strong>02:04</strong> And the winners are...&#039;The Weary Kind&#039;, Crazy Heart.</p>
<p><strong>02:04</strong> Couple of songs from Princess and the Frog, Crazy Heart, Nine, and a film we&#039;ve never heard of.</p>
<p><strong>02:03</strong> Has anyone heard of &#039;Paris 36&#039;? Because we haven&#039;t.</p>
<p><strong>02:02</strong> Peter is sad that Marion Cotillard is not performing live as a nominee for Best Song.</p>
<p><strong>02:02</strong> Best Original Song presented by Amanda Seyfried and Miley Cyrus. Amanda walked on several feet in front of Miley. She was clearly thinking &quot;I&#039;ve actually been in credible movies! Why am I sharing a stage with you?!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>02:00</strong> Oh dear. Steve and Alec are back.</p>
<p><strong>02:00</strong> Pete Docter praising the cast and crew, and Disney. &quot;The heart of the film came from home...parents were supportive, kids and wife too&quot;. That&#039;s sweet.</p>
<p><strong>01:59</strong> Another non-surprise. Still, yet another collective cheer from us.</p>
<p><strong>01:59</strong> And the winner is...Up!</p>
<p><strong>01:58</strong> Oh, Best Animated Feature Film!</p>
<p><strong>01:58</strong> I LOVE DUG (the dog from &#039;Up&#039;). If you haven&#039;t seen it, WATCH IT NOW - Hannah</p>
<p><strong>01:58</strong> The Secret of Kells freaks me out!</p>
<p><strong>01:57</strong> OMG. Faking cartoon interviews. CREEPY. SO CREEPY.</p>
<p><strong>01:57</strong> Steve Carrel and Cameron Diaz presenting the award for the animated features.</p>
<p><strong>01:54</strong> Apparently in the book Hannah is eating a woman is forced to eat eels and has a miscarriage. Let that be a lesson to all fish lovers everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>01:52</strong> Apparently, the awards are being brought to us by JC Penney.</p>
<p><strong>01:51</strong> We begin the review of the Best Picture nominees, starting with Ryan Reynolds introducing &#039;The Blind Side&#039;.</p>
<p><strong>01:51</strong> &#039;Everyone welcome Ryan Reynolds&#039;... &quot;Why?&quot; - Peter</p>
<p><strong>01:50</strong> Christoph Waltz listing a lot of names to thank. Quentin apparently has &#039;unorthodox methods of navigation&#039;. No surprises. Calls his Oscar a &#039;welcoming embrace&#039;. Aww. Love you!</p>
<p><strong>01:48</strong> Collective cheer from the living room.</p>
<p><strong>01:48</strong> And the winner is...Christoph Waltz!</p>
<p><strong>01:47</strong> The way Ms. Cruz speaks is just like listening to honey slowly drip through the heavens</p>
<p><strong>01:46</strong> This is a long review of nominees...only up to number 3 at the moment!</p>
<p><strong>01:45</strong> Matt Damon with a South African accent. Nat is in stitches!!!</p>
<p><strong>01:45</strong> WE (Hannah and Peter) LOVE YOU PENELOPE CRUZ!!!</p>
<p><strong>01:44</strong> Penelope Cruz up to present Best Supporting Actor.</p>
<p><strong>01:44</strong> &quot;Now it&#039;s time to give out the awards&quot;. Finally!</p>
<p><strong>01:44</strong> New Rule: If it makes us giggle it must be typed.</p>
<p><strong>01:43</strong> Steve Martin makes a joke about Christoph Waltz hunting Jews in Inglourious Basterds, and having hit the motherload in Hollywood. Lol (and I can say that, because I&#039;m Jewish - Nat).</p>
<p><strong>01:42</strong> Seriously, this is a painful start. Does not really bode well. Sadface!</p>
<p><strong>01:41</strong> George Clooney&#039;s unamused face is priceless.</p>
<p><strong>01:41</strong> Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin are doing jokes about Kathryn Bigelow and James Cameron&#039;s former marriage. AWKWARD.</p>
<p><strong>01:40</strong> Looks like Woody Harrelson&#039;s Thai Mail order bride made it as well.</p>
<p><strong>01:40</strong> Ha ha, mentioned James Cameron and whipped out two pairs of 3D glasses. And now they&#039;re surrounded by &#039;floating wood-sprites&#039; from the film.</p>
<p><strong>01:40</strong> There&#039;s an awkward balance between comedy and genuine congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>01:39</strong> Lots of applause for Mo&#039;nique. Bodes well.</p>
<p><strong>01:39</strong> More Hollywood in-jokes. We&#039;re at a distinct cultural disadvantage.</p>
<p><strong>01:38</strong> Meryl Streep mentioned twice in 5 mins. Nice.</p>
<p><strong>01:37</strong> The audience is following in the annoying American tradition of clapping whenever anyone&#039;s name is mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>01:37</strong> A moment of honour for Christopher Plummer from The Last Station.</p>
<p><strong>01:36</strong> Steve Martin: &quot;Meryl Streep holds the record for the most Oscar nominations, or as I like to call it, the most losses.&quot; HAHA.</p>
<p><strong>01:36</strong> Alec Baldwin introduces Steve Martin with a heap of praise...and Steve announces his co-host with simply &#039;And this is Alec Baldwin&#039;. LOL. Hollywood in-jokes.</p>
<p><strong>01:34</strong> Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin make their first appearance.</p>
<p><strong>01:34</strong> Suddenly, a swarm of feather clad dancers took to the stage.</p>
<p><strong>01:33</strong> Nice little musical opening number, all about not wanting to do it alone - like James Cameron with his CGI apparently.</p>
<p><strong>01:33</strong> Neil Patrick Harris is singing a really random song. Apparently prisoners pick up the soap because they don&#039;t want to do it alone... ew</p>
<p><strong>01:32</strong> NEIL PATRICK HARRIS!</p>
<p><strong>01:31</strong> They are literally just announcing their names. Way to show which awards are the most important.</p>
<p><strong>01:30</strong> All nominees for actor and actress on the main stage.</p>
<p><strong>01:30</strong> ZOMG IT&#039;S STARTING!!!</p>
<p><strong>01:30</strong> Awards show about to begin. Countdown is commencing...</p>
<p><strong>01:30</strong> Apparently young girls can make $500 with a lemonade stand... no need to whore yourselves for money. Just buy lemons!!!</p>
<p><strong>01:28</strong> Bowl for Bowl. Wag for Wag. We&#039;re getting excited about American dog food commercials</p>
<p><strong>01:28</strong> Trailer for The Back-Up Plan. That looks soooo bad...</p>
<p><strong>01:25</strong> Gabourey Sidibe&#039;s interviewer is SO patronising. She keeps pronouncing her name &#039;Gabba-Ray&#039;.</p>
<p><strong>01:25</strong> Oh lord Taylor Lautner. When will his face stop caving in!!!</p>
<p><strong>01:25</strong> Kate Winslet is so gracious. We think she&#039;ll be disappointed if she opens the envelope for Best Actor and it says Jeff Bridges instead of Colin Firth.</p>
<p><strong>01:23</strong> Jeff Bridges: winning the Oscar would be &quot;beautiful&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>01:22</strong> Tina Fey and Steve Carell being congratulated by being funny. No s**t Sherlock.</p>
<p><strong>01:22</strong> Sorry about the delay kids. Tina Fey and Steve Carell currently being interviewed together. Their interviewer praises them for being &quot;actually funny!&quot; Who knew.</p>
<p><strong>01:21</strong> Peter is getting angry with technology. More entertaining than the Oscars.</p>
<p><strong>01:11</strong> Got a nice little montage of nominated Best Picture films going on.</p>
<p><strong>01:10</strong> Sky Movies line-up: Claudia Winkleman presenting, Ronnie Ancona, David Baddiel and some randomo on the sofa. Of all the people....</p>
<p><strong>01:09</strong> According to Claudia Winkleman, Hugh Jackman and Richard Madeley are the same person. What planet is she living on?</p>
<p><strong>01:01</strong> Chris &quot;Captain Kirk&quot; Pine is cutting it fine, he has 20 seconds to talk to Ryan Seacrest, explaining that he was late because he was taking pictures with his mum. Bless!</p>
<p><strong>00:59</strong> Peter: &quot;I don&#039;t want another Shrek!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>00:59</strong> Cameron Diaz in a pale gold coloured dress with gold flecks scattered over it. Very nice.</p>
<p><strong>00:57</strong> 2 mins to the start. Whoop!</p>
<p><strong>00:56</strong> Kate Winslet looking amazing in a pearl dress. Classy as always.</p>
<p><strong>00:55</strong> Best Actor people&#039;s poll: 35% for George Clooney, second with Jeff Bridges 27%. That&#039;s a shock.</p>
<p><strong>00:54</strong> Nat: &quot;Do not put Miley Cyrus and Meryl Streep in the same sentence!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>00:54</strong> Jeff &#039;The Dude&#039; Bridges: if he wins Best Actor tonight, it will probably be an acknowledgment of his entire career.</p>
<p><strong>00:52</strong> Jason Bateman: &quot;You always wanna play the guy you hate, not be the guy you hate&quot; on his character in Up in the Air.</p>
<p><strong>00:50</strong> Gerard Butler&#039;s having to explain to Ryan Seacrest what a mooney is.</p>
<p><strong>00:50</strong> Stop calling Gerard Butler GerARD. He&#039;s Scottish! It&#039;s Gerard! (Obviously you can&#039;t get the enunciation from type, but I&#039;m shouting it loudly).</p>
<p><strong>00:49</strong> Dear Hannah McCarthy -  You are such a fangirl. I love it!!!</p>
<p><strong>00:48</strong> Who would win in a bint-off? Miley Cyrus or Kristin Stewart?</p>
<p><strong>00:47</strong> The dip is half-way done and is beginning to lose cohesion!!!</p>
<p><strong>00:44</strong> I LOVE Robert Downey Jr.&#039;s blue bow tie, but not as much as I love him - Hannah. Apparently Ozzy Osbourne wants RDJ to play him in a movie. Now THAT we&#039;d love to see.</p>
<p><strong>00:42</strong> Patronising comments from the red carpet &#039;Sky Box&#039;, saying Gabourey Sidibe&#039;s self-confidence is amazing.</p>
<p><strong>00:42</strong> Dear Gabourey Sidibe - Stop doing the &#039;I&#039;m A Little Teapot&#039; dance!!!</p>
<p><strong>00:40</strong> Gabourey Sidibe: &quot;If fashion was porn, this dress is the moneyshot.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>00:40</strong> Woody Harrelson and Gabourey Sidibe share an awkward kiss mid-interview. He walked away rather quickly.</p>
<p><strong>00:39</strong> Kristen Stewart looks so much better than she has done all awards season, but Peter still thinks she looks like a &quot;gormless bint&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>00:35</strong> Women get to wear so many different things, us men have to stick with tuxedos. It&#039;s not that I want to have a plunging neckline but the option of variability would be nice.</p>
<p><strong>00:34</strong> J-Lo&#039;s dress makes it look like she&#039;s having a baby out of her hip.</p>
<p><strong>00:32</strong> Meryl Streep jokes about about being nominated 117 times... probably will be true one day</p>
<p><strong>00:32</strong> Meryl Streep says &quot;everybody in America&quot; is in love with Sandra Bullock. That&#039;s a bit presumptuous.</p>
<p><strong>00:32</strong> Meryl Streep and Ryan Seacrest are getting rather close during her interview.</p>
<p><strong>00:32</strong> Meryl Streep - LOVELY! Plunging neckline full length white dress-suit. A vast improvement from last year&#039;s grey nothing.</p>
<p><strong>00:31</strong> <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> does not support the betting of all your worldly possessions</p>
<p><strong>00:31</strong> Another dirty pink, this time from Queen Latifah. Jewelled belt going around the middle - ooo, matching earrings!</p>
<p><strong>00:31</strong> George Clooney says &#039;bet all your property&#039; on Jeff Bridges getting the oscar</p>
<p><strong>00:29</strong> George Clooney&#039;s date Elisabetta Canalis in a very classic red number.</p>
<p><strong>00:29</strong> Colin Firth wearing a Tom Ford suit. What else?</p>
<p><strong>00:28</strong> Colin Firth interviewed with his wife Livia, who&#039;s doing a green carpet challenge for Vogue where all of her dresses for awards season are ethically sourced. We love this couple.</p>
<p><strong>00:28</strong> Matt Damon and Michael Douglas are lovers in their next film. That&#039;s a bit of a disturbing image.</p>
<p><strong>00:27</strong> Matt Damon talks about his &#039;once in a lifetime&#039; opportunity working with Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman. &quot;After making movies for so many decades, he [Eastwood] really knows what he&#039;s doing&quot;. Go figure.</p>
<p><strong>00:27</strong> Yay Matt Damon! He was &quot;flabberghasted&quot; by being a part of &#039;Invictus&#039;.</p>
<p><strong>00:26</strong> I love with how much difficulty the word &#039;rugby&#039; rolls off Ryan Seacrest&#039;s tongue (talking to Matt Damon about Invictus).</p>
<p><strong>00:26</strong> Oooh burn. When Meryl Streep won her last Oscar Carey Mulligan and Gabourney Sidibe weren&#039;t even born!!</p>
<p><strong>00:24</strong> For anyone that doesn&#039;t understand, Peter&#039;s quoting an Ariel ad.</p>
<p><strong>00:23</strong> What is the first thing u do when YOU have a stain?</p>
<p><strong>00:23</strong> There&#039;s a lull in proceedings as we quietly consider the adverts. Apparently some toothpaste makes your teeth white.</p>
<p><strong>00:22</strong> Charlize Theron wearing a pink dress which is mostly nice...except what&#039;s going on around the breasts. Just a lot of material around ONLY her breasts. It makes them look smushed, and kind of makes you mentally jump to a nasty place.</p>
<p><strong>00:20</strong> Stanley Tucci says he didn&#039;t ever want to play a character like the one he did in The Lovely Bones, but he found the story so beautiful. I imagine he&#039;s not referring to the child-killing.</p>
<p><strong>00:20</strong> Rachel McAdams looks gorgeous in a layered grey dress with blue/green flecks, and she&#039;s just amazing anyway.</p>
<p><strong>00:19</strong> Ooh, Ryan Seacrest asks Kathryn Bigelow what she&#039;ll say to James Cameron if she wins. Luckily she handles the question with grace and says that she&#039;s honoured even to be in the same category as him.</p>
<p><strong>00:17</strong> Bloody hell. Either Kathryn Bigelow is very tall or Ryan Seacrest is very short.</p>
<p><strong>00:17</strong> Who does Matt Broderick think he is? Who knows? This must be solved!</p>
<p><strong>00:17</strong> SJP dress....this is a big one...unfortunately, not very flattering, but it&#039;s a rather interesting shade of pale yellow and silky material. But the silver roses up top kind of ruin it.</p>
<p><strong>00:16</strong> Nat is sad that she doesn&#039;t like Sarah Jessica Parker&#039;s dress.</p>
<p><strong>00:15</strong> Miley Cyrus&#039; mother just flaunted one of the trashiest tattoos ever: angels wings on her back. (This comes from someone who loves tattoos, btw).</p>
<p><strong>00:14</strong> Kathryn Bigelow - Lovely classy grey dress. She MUST WIN!!!</p>
<p><strong>00:14</strong> Dear Miley Cyrus - Stop plugging your film and fall through the nearest manhole... kthnxbi</p>
<p><strong>00:12</strong> Nat and Hannah are making tea and going gaga over rainbow mugs. Peter is left watching commercials...</p>
<p><strong>00:10</strong> Public prediction for Best Actress: 69% Sandra Bullock. Standard. Closest competitor is Gabourey Sidibe at 14%. Shame, because she probably deserves it more.</p>
<p><strong>00:08</strong> Antonio Banderas + beard = BAD.</p>
<p><strong>00:07</strong> Jake Gyllenhaal - Hannah loves him.</p>
<p><strong>00:07</strong> Miley Cyrus is apparently presenting an award *shudder*</p>
<p><strong>00:07</strong> Miley Cyrus appearing on screen forces a collective loud groan from all of us.</p>
<p><strong>00:03</strong> Faith Hill in a black number, tight-fitting on the top half, high-rise slit with a little bit of lace too. Very nice.</p>
<p><strong>00:02</strong> View of the street outside the Kodak: massive traffic jam of black limos. Nowhere would you see that but Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>00:00</strong> Sandra Bullock looks so nervous right now, bless her.</p>
<p><strong>00:00</strong> The guy who played &#039;Big Mike&#039; in The Blind Side is well and truly massive. Hannah thought he was a bodyguard.</p>
<p><strong>23:59</strong> Diane Krueger - looking very odd. Middle third of her dress is a very frilly, bordered by what looks like black feather boas, along with an extra one around her neck.</p>
<p><strong>23:58</strong> Is Sandra Bullock trying to look like a male Oscar statuette with her gold dress?</p>
<p><strong>23:56</strong> &#039;More dip please&#039; - Nat.</p>
<p><strong>23:55</strong> Tonight&#039;s target: more viewers than the Hustings liveblog.</p>
<p><strong>23:53</strong> I don&#039;t care about Kendra or the Kardashians... please SHUT UP E!</p>
<p><strong>23:53</strong> Tina Fey says her new film &#039;Date Night&#039; is &quot;really funny&quot; despite having publicly disowned it. Awkward.</p>
<p><strong>23:52</strong> Tina Fey just skipped the queue to talk to Ryan Seacrest leaving supporting actor nominee Christoph Waltz waiting in the wings.</p>
<p><strong>23:51</strong> Sandra Bullock in a lovely gold number, with a nice lacy flower top half. But classy, definitely classy.</p>
<p><strong>23:51</strong> Peter mistakes Eli Roth for Zachary Quinto. Apparently &quot;they&#039;re the same person!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>23:50</strong> Sigourney Weaver talks about how it took her 3 days to read the script to Avatar, but she believed &#039;Jim&#039; Cameron could pull it off.</p>
<p><strong>23:49</strong> </p>
<div style="float: right; width: 180px; padding: 2px"><a href="../../../photos/full/4678.jpg"><img src="../../../photos/medium/4678.jpg" width="180" height="145" title="Oscar dip" alt="Oscar dip"  /></a><div>Peter proudly presents his 5 layer Oscar dip.</div></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>23:46</strong> Who will be the first to taste Peter&#039;s 5 layer tortilla dip? And the winner is.... Nat! Her reaction: &quot;nice&quot;</p>
<p><strong>23:46</strong> Public Prediction for Best Supp. Actress... Mo&#039;Nique wins with 72%
WOAH!!! (Sponsored by AT&amp;T ^^)</p>
<p><strong>23:45</strong> Tom Ford&#039;s being interviewed - he wasn&#039;t nominated as director and neither was his film &#039;A Single Man&#039;. SNUBBED.</p>
<p><strong>23:42</strong> COOKIES!</p>
<p><strong>23:42</strong> Apparently it&#039;s Peter Sarsgaard&#039;s birthday. Bless</p>
<p><strong>23:41</strong> Maggie Gyllenhaal looks BEAUTIFUL. Mix of blue, black and grey shades. Shoulderless yet draped over her very nicely.</p>
<p><strong>23:40</strong> Vera Farmiga&#039;s dress makes another appearance. Nat says it makes her cry inside.</p>
<p><strong>23:40</strong> Elizabeth Banks dress = Ride of the Valkyries?</p>
<p><strong>23:39</strong> Oh, and he has a matching colour handkerchief in his pocket.</p>
<p><strong>23:39</strong> James Cameron&#039;s being interviewed now. His wife&#039;s wearing &quot;Navi blue&quot; he says.</p>
<p><strong>23:39</strong> Sigourney Weaver&#039;s appearance elicits &quot;oohs&quot; from the three of us. Move over starlets, that&#039;s how you do class.</p>
<p><strong>23:37</strong> Jason Reitman (Up in the Air director) is up. Says he was playing X-Box to reduce his anxiety. Aww.</p>
<p><strong>23:36</strong> TINA FEY! IT&#039;S TINA FEY!</p>
<p><strong>23:36</strong> Ryan Reynolds looking dashing. He says he&#039;s going to present a bit about The Blind Side. He says he&#039;s very proud of Sandra Bullock (his The Proposal co-star).</p>
<p><strong>23:34</strong> Am eating cookie dough with a knife... not a wise idea. Ow - Peter</p>
<p><strong>23:32</strong> Vera&#039;s picks for Best Picture and Director are The Hurt Locker and Kathryn Bigelow. Way to (covertly) crap on Avatar. Not that there&#039;s anything wrong with that.</p>
<p><strong>23:30</strong> Dear Vera Farminga - no matter how many folds you put on your dress you are not a rose... you&#039;re over thirty. The jig is up.</p>
<p><strong>23:29</strong> Vera Farmiga: Nat says - &quot;TRAVESTY!&quot; It looks like that crinkly red paper you get in Boyes.</p>
<p><strong>23:28</strong> Why are Joel Madden and Nicole Ritchie doing here? Apparently he&#039;s &quot;entertaining&quot; the crowd in between... whatever.</p>
<p><strong>23:27</strong> Really Nat? To me it looks like she&#039;s being molested by a Kraken!</p>
<p><strong>23:27</strong> Zoe Saldana from Avatar now. Her dress is reminiscent of those Barbie cakes you had as a kid. But purple. Really PURPLE.</p>
<p><strong>23:22</strong> First glance of Amanda Seyfried. Beige dress which has a sharp geometric-style round bit around her breasts. Kinda weird.</p>
<p><strong>23:20</strong> Did Ryan Seacrest just put on a British accent? Ew.</p>
<p><strong>23:19</strong> ok Mariah Carey referred to her breasts as &#039;the girls&#039; hmmm</p>
<p><strong>23:19</strong> Mariah Carey&#039;s husband is a bit concerned about how high her navy dress is rising. Never woulda thought.</p>
<p><strong>23:18</strong> Peter: Why are the Academy Awards sponsered by Greece?</p>
<p><strong>23:15</strong> As the break comes in, on the menu is five layer Mexican dip and home-made choc chip cookies. Mmm!</p>
<p><strong>23:13</strong> According to Ryan Seacrest, rain falls in &quot;cells&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>23:12</strong> Nat: Monique is wearing a lovely royal blue. She&#039;s being very grateful and profound - &quot;we&#039;re nothing but kids with grown-up faces&quot;. Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>23:10</strong> Anna Kendrick&#039;s dress: Nat&#039;s calling it dirty pink. Apparently the designer is a mystery, but we like it. Thumbs up.</p>
<p><strong>23:06</strong> Woohoo! Here we are - chair of YSC Peter Searle, our fabulous Film and TV Editor Nat Sasic, and our Deputy Arts Editor Hannah McCarthy - watching the red carpet with Ryan Seacrest. We&#039;re in for a long night.</p>
