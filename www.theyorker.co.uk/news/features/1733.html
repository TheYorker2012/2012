		</div>
		<div class="SubText">When I tell people that last summer I volunteered at an American summer camp designed for the children of atheists, agnostics and other non-believers, I get very mixed reactions. Some even react as if I were trying to abolish religion, brainwashing children with my &#039;liberal agenda&#039;, or force communism on the innocent little ones. So, now that Camp Quest is due to arrive in the UK in 2009, I feel I should set the record straight. </div>

        <p>Camp Quest is a non-profit organisation that provides residential summer camps for children of those who choose not to believe in a god, and who want their children to learn the values of critical thinking, philosophy and science. It is the first summer camp of its kind in North America, started in 1996 by Edwin and Helen Kagin as an alternative to the pro-theist policy of the Boy Scouts of America.</p>
<p>In the Scouts, in order for a person to be granted membership or a position of leadership, he must sign a &#039;Declaration of Religious Belief&#039;, in which he must agree that &quot;only a person who acknowledges his duty to God can be the best kind of citizen&quot;. It is not specified which god they must believe in, be it Allah, Yahweh, or Lord Xenu, but this discriminatory policy against atheists (as well as homosexuals) exists in the UK as well.</p>
<p>Since 1996, the original Camp Quest in Ohio has blossomed into five more across North America, including the most recent addition: Camp Quest Michigan. It was here that I volunteered my services. But sitting on the plane to Detroit, I certainly had my doubts about exactly what I was getting myself into.</p>
<p>To all intents and purposes I had just spent most of my remaining student loan on a plane ticket to a city about which I knew nothing (other than that a lot of people get shot there), to meet a group of complete strangers with whom I would work for a week at a YMCA camp, no less, in a state which ranks reasonably high on the scale of religious nuts. Not to mention the fact that I would have to spend my waking hours taking care of other people&#039;s children.</p>
<p>At immigration, I was reasonably concerned about telling them the true nature of my visit, and even more about telling them that I had not met one of these so-called &ldquo;friends&rdquo; I was visiting. I was greeted at the airport by the Camp Director, a gentle, soft-spoken bearded man who was exceedingly hospitable to me throughout my stay. As I was introduced to the other counsellors, I was thrown without warning into a group of individuals who were all articulate, passionate, intelligent and hilarious. Every single conversation with them was stimulating, inspiring and entertaining. I felt a part of the team immediately.</p>
<p>Although many of the campers were returning for a second year, several newcomers arrived on the first day just as unsure and wide eyed as I, burdened with the usual camp fears added to the fact that everyone knows that atheists eat babies, and very occasionally, small children. They were to be left, for an entire week, with lunatics who think that learning about Fibonacci numbers is more fun than hurling rocks at each other. Once the camp routine was established, and their homesickness settled down, some of them even began to - gasp - have a good time (you know, despite the weather, bugs and the lunatics... I mean, counsellors).</p>
<p></p>

<br /><span class="author"></span>
</div></blockquote><p>Soon enough, the children began to open up, telling horror stories from their schools about anti-evolution teachers and the isolation they felt from other children, and it was then that I realised what a blessing (pardon my language) this organisation is. It became evident that for some of them it was the first time they were in a place where it was OK to believe whatever they believed; to express their thoughts and ideas without fear of mockery or reprimands and where they were allowed to question the supposed wisdom of authority. There was no &ldquo;atheist agenda&rdquo; imposed on the children; we made it clear from the start that we stood for free enquiry and respect for each other&#039;s views.</p>
<p>The most striking thing about these children was their minds. Without exception, the kids were exceptional. Their precociousness emanated from every aspect of their being, and while the younger ones merely thought that religion was a bit ridiculous, the older ones made a conscious effort to embrace reason and rationality.</p>
<p></p>

<br /><span class="author"></span>
</div></blockquote><p>Not that we supervised a camp filled with the mini versions of Richard Dawkins: these are normal kids who enjoy sponge fights and soaking their counsellors with &ldquo;water&rdquo; (the filth in the bottom of the alligator tank) just as much as the next child. They are living, breathing, crying, bleeding kids - but I truly believe these children are our future, set to become the people that change the world: doctors, lawyers, presidents. Some of them might even grow up to be Camp Quest counsellors.</p>
<p>Aside from bleeding and boring them to death trying to be educational, the camp took on a very relaxed, informal atmosphere. The kids took part in high ropes courses, canoeing, archery, zip lines, and a number of other regular camp activities. In the evenings we had campfires, discussions about disproving the existence of invisible unicorns (as a metaphor for gods), astronomy lessons, talent shows, traditional American &ldquo;S&#039;mores&rdquo; and near death sugar highs from Edwin&#039;s peach cobbler surprise.</p>
<p>Despite the mosquitos, long hours, and exhaustingly intelligent children (in addition to my jet-lag), it was bliss. On the last two nights of camp, we were fortunate enough to be able to watch the Perseid Meteor Shower from our camp fire ring. And staring up at the stars, I am convinced I felt both more alive and more at peace than any amount of religion or faith could induce.</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly echo Richard Feynman&rsquo;s sentiments: &ldquo;But I don&#039;t have to know an answer. I don&#039;t feel frightened by not knowing things, by being lost in the mysterious universe without having any purpose - which is the way it really is, as far as I can tell, possibly. It doesn&#039;t frighten me.&quot;</p>
<p>I do hope that the children of Camp Quest will take great pleasure in knowing that they do not have to have all the answers to life. Pretty hard for a bunch of fantastic know-it-alls.</p>

<p>As someone involved in Scouts and Guides...I&#039;d just like to just point out that in Britain you don&#039;t have to sign anything, and though you have to make a promise in which you pledge to love your God, you can miss that bit out if you don&#039;t agree with it. But if you don&#039;t believe in God (as I don&#039;t) then pledging allegience to one makes very little difference anyway!</p>
<p>But I agree its very different in America (I heard that 50% of Americans wouldn&#039;t vote an atheist for President under any circumstances) so this camp sounds fab <img src="../../images/smileys/grin.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>I was in the brownies when younger and really resented having to pledge my love to both God and the Queen. The whole Scouting movement advocates honesty, and yet seems happy to makes kids who don&#039;t believe say it anyway (I guess it depends on what group you were in as to how religious you had to be - I imagine they vary a great deal when it comes to this sort of thing)</p>
<p>The implication was essentially that I would be a better person if I had faith in a god. I was 8 or 9 at the time, but it still made me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>And yes, I heard that figure too, although apparently Scientologists have now overtaken atheists as the least trusted minority... <img src="../../images/smileys/tongue_wink.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>&quot;...discussions about disproving the existence of invisible unicorns (as a metaphor for gods)&quot;</p>
<p>First of all, I think it&#039;s great that kids can go to a camp where there seems to be some real intellectual stimulation going on. Normally I would question the value of making it a specifically atheist camp. If you don&#039;t want your camp to be about religion why even bring it up? The idea of it being &#039;atheists only&#039; seems just as polarising to me as &#039;religion X only&#039;, but the US does seem to have a real problem with somewhat extreme fundamentalism so perhaps it is helpful to kids who feel oppressed by religion in their everyday life.</p>
<p>That said, I find statements like the one above somewhat troubling. At what point does it stop being a stimulating environment for naturalism and start being intolerant of religion and those with faith? Debunking gods as &#039;invisible unicorns&#039; is a hugely inaccurate analogy that ignores and trivialises what is a very, very big part of life for millions of people. Regardless of how much we all   think we &#039;know better&#039; (for want of a better phrase) and how important it is to keep asking these questions, it&#039;s just as important to not be dicks about it (e.g. Dawkins).</p>

<p>Jeremy,</p>
<p>The camp is not &quot;atheists only&quot;, anyone is welcome to come. Plenty of the kids self-identify as agnostic, humanist or freethinkers. Kids of Christians are welcome, although they might not like how their kids come back - full of questions. The kids at camp quest find it hugely encouraging to know that they arent the only ones - it builds a sort of community which is freely available to the religious (eg church gatherings).</p>
<p>I&#039;ll explain about the unicorns challenge. It isn&#039;t trivialising the matter at all. The counsellors at CQ all have &quot;faith&quot; in these invisible unicorns. The kids are challenged to &quot;disprove&quot; their existence. But year after year, they can&#039;t do it (the original prize still stands). Transfer this to talking about god(s), and it teaches them a valuable lesson that it is practically impossible to disprove that which relies on faith alone.</p>
<p>No one is being a dick about it, least of all Dawkins. It&#039;s an extremely tolerant atmosphere.</p>

<ul id="CommentItem3090History" class="comment_edit"><li>Tue, 13th May 2008 4:26am - Edited by the author</li></ul><p>I&#039;m glad to hear that the camp is open to everyone and that kids can benefit from a break from what I imagine must be a very stifling atmosphere for many young people.</p>
<p>I do see the unicorn thing as being useful to children in terms of &#039;it&#039;s hard to disprove faith.&#039; It struck a chord as it always gets me when people argue that someone may as well believe in leprechauns and pixie dust if they have a religion. I now realise that this is not the accusation being made with the exercise, but I&#039;d be worried that it could be misinterpreted by children as &quot;believing in gods is like believing in unicorns&quot; rather than the desired lesson (&quot;proving the absence of god(s) is like proving the absence of unicorns&quot;). Hopefully the distinction is made clear to the students. Out of curiosity, what is the age range of the kids who attend Camp Quest?</p>
<p>I was probably a bit out of line with the whole &#039;being a dick&#039; thing. I certainly didn&#039;t mean to imply that you or the counselors were acting in the wrong (apologies if it came off that way), but rather that it&#039;s important that the kids don&#039;t pick up lessons which lead them to be intolerant. As for Dawkins, I agree with many of his points on religion but feel he is rather heavy handed and sometimes insulting/patronising with them. Maybe it&#039;s what&#039;s necessary to counter extremism, but I&#039;d like to think it&#039;s not.</p>

<p>They welcome kids aged between 8 and 17, but typically they are 9-14 (if there are older kids, they usually get the opportunity to become &quot;junior counsellors&quot;, with a bit of responsibility and a few privileges)</p>
<p>Most kids don&#039;t explicitly get the metaphor for god - the unicorn thing distracts them. But I like to think it does teach them that arguing for the sake of arguing - or &quot;being right&quot; is often fruitless.</p>
<p>You make an interesting point about Dawkins. I recently had the fortune of seeing him give a talk and also managed to talk to him for a few minutes (whoo hoo! fulfilled my life&#039;s dream right there...). Granted, his talk was to a bunch of atheists, but he came across as articulate and extremely funny. Plus, he&#039;s a great listener (especially when confronted by insane rambling fans - tee hee)</p>
<p>The times I have seen him debate in mixed company (for example, on &quot;The Big Questions&quot; on BBC1) he made his points without attacking anyone, and presented himself in a calm and dignified manner.</p>
<p>I suspect he would like to use more subtlety, but is fully aware that it just doesn&#039;t get through to some people.</p>
<p>The only time I had seen him really lose it is on &quot;The root of all evil?&quot; - a face off with Teg Haggard. Makes compulsive viewing though<img src="../../images/smileys/smile.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Oh yeah, Haggard. Things sure turned out well for him didn&#039;t they... Dawkins was spot on in that interview to point out to him that he obviously knew nothing about evolution. It&#039;s cool that you got to see him speak, I&#039;d certainly like to.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for the article. I&#039;d not heard about Camp Quest or its kind before, really interesting read.</p>

<p>Let us confront the big question: where do we come from?</p>
<p>It has been common among religious believers to look with misgiving at atheists and agnostics, and to think that they are mistaken; however, in many instances the opposite is the truth; some religious beliefs are not just baseless, but obsolete and irrelevant. The fantasy &ldquo;God&rdquo; of main line traditions simply does not exist. Most people don&rsquo;t dare to confront their religious doubts; they are afraid of abandoning the &ldquo;certainty&rdquo; of their convictions, and opt for the status quo. It is unbelievable how myths and a religious fantasy have influenced human minds with more strength than reality!</p>
<p>On the other hand, it seems that agnostics and atheists do not dare to confront and accept the logic and the reality that &ldquo;there is no effect without cause.&rdquo; If this world exists, it must have a cause. We cannot assert that they were only naturalistic causes as natural selection, because these need also a reason for their existence. So, the only logical explanation is the existence of an Existence by itself (capital, because it is unique, its proper name), which must be necessary and infinite, and therefore not physical. You might call it &ldquo;Something&rdquo; or &ldquo;Someone;&rdquo; names do not matter. There is probably a single issue in which I do not agree with atheists: that reason and logic do not force us to accept an uncaused-cause. There is no alternative.</p>
<p>There is a book that might help those with religious doubts or full of religious illusions: &ldquo;Christianity Reformed From ist Roots &ndash; A Life Centered in God.&rdquo; Distinguished philosophers and thinkers might give you an idea of this book&mdash;perhaps a generation ahead of time for most believers&mdash;(links below); or you might look at excerpts at Amazon.com.</p>

<p>&quot;If this world exists, it must have a cause.&quot;</p>
<p>Indeed, but let us not be mistaking the word &#039;cause&#039; for the word &#039;reason&#039;. The cause may as well be explainable by physics, with string theory being a leading candidate so far.</p>
<p>&quot;So, the only logical explanation is the existence of an Existence by itself&quot;</p>
<p>And the only logical conclusion, given your previous assertion, is that it must have a cause too, leading to the next question; who created your &#039;creator&#039;? Your line of argument quickly ends in an infinite recursive loop. Even if you naively wave off the question by arguing that the &#039;creator&#039; was never created, then you are just contradicting your own self; as you said, every effect must have a cause.</p>
