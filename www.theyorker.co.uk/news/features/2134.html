		<div class="SubText">So, now that it&#039;s all over, and you are slowly recovering from Freshers&#039; flu, or suddenly remembering that you came here to study something... how did you rate York University Freshers&#039; Week 2008? Whether the best week of your life, one embarrassing saga after another,  a tedious tradition, or something you are glad to have got through alive... The Yorker asks this year&#039;s freshers themselves to find out more.</div>

        

<h3> Social Policy student, Charlie Rowley, Goodricke College </h3>

<p><strong>What was your best moment of the week?</strong>
The first bar crawl we did to Tru, when it got really hot. It was jam-packed in there!</p>
<p><strong>What was your worst?</strong>
Waking up the next day.</p>
<p><strong>How do you rate the support your college has given you so far?</strong>
I&#039;d give college support a 5, just because the Stycs were so good.
<strong>Rating: 5/5</strong></p>
<p><strong>How do you rate the York nightlife so far?</strong>
Everywhere we&#039;ve been to has been good and crowded with students. I think it&#039;ll get even better once we know where we&#039;re going...
I&#039;m not over-keen on Ziggy&#039;s though; the stairway was too narrow and overcrowded.
<strong>Rating: 4/5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you think you got value for money?</strong>
Well I would have said yeah, but after reading the student newspapers I&#039;m not so sure...
But our college Freshers&#039; Week ticket was only &pound;20, so over all I&#039;d say it was pretty good value for money.
<strong>Rating: 3/5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Was it the best week of your life?!</strong>
No, but I&#039;m a tough nut to crack.</p>


<h3> Bio-Chemistry student, Kate Hogan, James College </h3>

<p><strong>What was your best moment of the week?</strong>
The bar crawl with Goodricke was great for family bonding. Flares  is amazing! We all came out wearing massive sunglasses.</p>
<p><strong>What was your worst?</strong>
I got lost in town. I had to phone my dad [James College has parents and grandparents as opposed to Stycs] and he came to save me. My dad rules!</p>
<p><strong>How do you rate the support your college has given you so far?</strong>
Awesome. If I didn&#039;t have Mum and Dad I&#039;d be screwed.
<strong>Rating: 5/5</strong></p>
<p><strong>How do you rate the York nightlife so far?</strong>
It&#039;s okay actually, not as horrific as I thought it would be. I went to Tru but it sucks. Ziggy&#039;s is boss.
<strong>Rating: 4/5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you think you got value for money?</strong>
Yeah. Our Freshers&#039; Week has been so good, and really well organised.
<strong>Rating: 5/5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Was it the best week of your life?!</strong>
No.</p>


<h3> Sociology, Psychology and Education student, Kaitlyn Krauskopf, Halifax College </h3>

<p><strong>What was your best moment of the week?</strong>
My 21st Birthday night, by far!!! I was completely wasted but still had a great time. Also loved dancing at Gallery and Ziggy&#039;s.</p>
<p><strong>What was your worst?</strong>
Paying money for that stupid Access All Areas - totally not worth it. And not knowing about my courses/nobody helping me with registration - that was really difficult.</p>
<p><strong>How do you rate the support your college has given you so far?</strong>
Pretty good, I really liked the Stycs. But the uni support system has been pretty crap in comparison.
<strong>Rating: 4/5</strong></p>
<p><strong>How do you rate the York nightlife so far?</strong>
Fantastic!! 5 out of 5, definitely. Student nights are amazing and can be relatively affordable.
<strong>Rating: 5/5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you think you got value for money?</strong>
Didn&#039;t get my value for my money at Gallery on Friday (waaaay too expensive to get in), and Access All Areas was pretty much a complete waste of money.
<strong>Rating: 3/5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Was it the best week of your life?!</strong>
No.</p>


<h3> <strong>English student, Damien, Langwith College</strong> </h3>

<p><strong>What was your best moment of the week?</strong>
The Langwith bar FTSE event. Everyone in the college was there and the drinks were really cheap.</p>
<p><strong>What was your worst?</strong>
Can I skip that one?!</p>
<p><strong>How do you rate the support your college has given you so far?</strong>
No experience of college support. Joke. Langwith has been really good - the Stycs have been great. They brought bread, milk and wine round on the first night and since then have shown us all the cool places to hang on and off campus.
<strong>Rating: 5/5</strong></p>
<p><strong>How do you rate York nightlife so far?</strong>
Well, so far I have been to Tru, Reflex and Yates. It&#039;s been alright, quite good. I think you are guaranteed to have a good time with all the cheap drinks deals and the general freshers&#039; spirit.
<strong>Rating: 3/5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you think you got value for money?</strong>
Yes, I have not been ripped off at all. I&#039;ve been drunk at a reasonable cost. The Langwith ticket for all the events was &pound;18 which was great.
<strong>Rating: 4/5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Was it the best week of your life?</strong>
Yes. It&#039;s been damn good.</p>


<h3>Medical student, Andy Kermode, Alcuin College</h3>

<p><strong>What was your best moment of the week?</strong>
It has to be Alcuin bar crawl, closely followed by the silent disco at Alcuin. The bar crawl gave me a chance to show our true Alcuin colours by face-painting up, and who doesn&#039;t love a bit of facepaint eh?! Even if it is a pain to get off the next morning!</p>
<p><strong>What was your worst?</strong>
As a medic we&#039;ve been working throughout, attending lectures and going to PBL sessions, and also working in the flat. At the moment I&#039;m sitting next to a pile of work that needs to be done before tomorrow...</p>
<p><strong>How do you rate the support your college has given you so far?</strong>
It was really good actually! Our Stycs were all very friendly, and although I didn&#039;t see them as much as the Freshers&#039; Week went along that was probably a good thing as it gave us time to get to know each other rather than the Stycs. Massive shout out to Mike the most awesome Styc ever!
<strong>Rating: 5/5</strong></p>
<p><strong>What do you think of the York night life so far?</strong>
It&#039;s amazing! Prior to Freshers&#039; Week the medics went to Leeds, and in comparison I think I&#039;ll stay in York any day. I&#039;m not the biggest fan of Gallery, but my first impressions of Tru were brilliant, and the Nag&#039;s Head just can&#039;t be beaten for value. Love it!
<strong>Rating: 5/5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you think you got value for money?</strong>
The Freshers&#039; Ball was really expensive and the drinks ridiculously priced, especially for a student starting off a five year long course! At &pound;3.60 for a pint of Guiness poured out of a can, you know something is going wrong. <strong>Rating: 2/5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Was it the best week of your life?</strong> Probably not, as it involved a heafty amount of work, but it&#039;s definitely been an awesome way to start off first year!</p>


<h3> English student, Molly Riggins, Derwent College </h3>

<p><strong>What was your best moment of the week?</strong>
It would have to be <em>Slag&#039;n&#039;Drag</em> - teaching the boys in the house to dance
sexily to &#039;Low&#039; by Flo Rida, and realising (disturbingly) that they do it
far better than the girls.</p>
<p><strong>What was your worst moment of the week?</strong>
Being hungover pretty much every morning, and realising that being a student entails going to lectures, working etc.</p>
<p><strong>How do you rate the support your college has given you so far?</strong>
A good 4/5 - the college put on lots of events and our Stycs have been absolutely fantastic: showing us around, taking us out and getting us
very, very drunk!
<strong>Rating: 4/5</strong></p>
<p><strong>What do you think of the York night life so far?</strong>
Hard to say as we&#039;ve only been in to York once, but it was a great night.
<strong>Rating: 4/5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you think you got value for money?</strong>
Yes, because we got tickets to all of the events and a meal at the provost&#039;s. However, I don&#039;t feel as though the Freshers&#039; Ball ticket was good value for money. Although it was a really good night we had to pay &pound;30 for travel to York racecourse where we then had to buy all our own drinks.
<strong>Rating: 4/5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Was it the best week of your life?</strong>
One of them, yes!</p>
<p><em>So, it seems that Freshers&#039; Week can be the best week of your life, but for most it is just a great week of night after night out, college bonding and finding your way around York - all in a pretty much constant state of inebriation. Great value for money to some, a bit of a rip-off to others, over-all I think it&#039;s fair to say that at least these Freshers enjoyed their first experiences of York. Even though, like all students, they disagree as to whether Tru or Ziggy&#039;s carry the day.</em></p>
