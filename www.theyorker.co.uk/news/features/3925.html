		<div class="SubText">Being the last college on campus to hold their elections, all eyes are on Goodricke&rsquo;s potential JCRC Chairs! This year, we see an unparalleled amount of four candidates for the position of Goodricke JCRC Chair. The Yorker brings you an in-depth look on each of the candidates- Alex Christopher Robin Chadwick, Tim Ellis and Sophie Walker to help all of you make informed choices. </div>

        <p>Danny Munro is running for Chair as a first year. He was unfortunately unavailable to comment.</p>
<p><span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>: <strong>How was hustings night?</strong></p>
<p><strong>ACRC:</strong> Hustings was good for me. It gave me a chance to see all the different candidates for all of the positions and also how similar some of our views on how the JCRC should be run are.</p>
<p><strong>SW:</strong> Hustings was brilliant. Obviously, I was nervous, but it was great fun, and I thought the Vice Chairs of Goodricke JCRC 08/09 did a good job putting it together.</p>
<p><strong>TE:</strong> I really enjoyed hustings despite a few nerves and it was great to be able to share my policies and plans for next year. I was slightly disappointed there weren&#039;t a few more people there by the end though to hear the potential chairs speak.</p>
<p><span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>: <strong>Why did you decide to run?</strong></p>
<p><strong>ACRC:</strong> Because I think the JCRC needs a breath of fresh air in charge of it. I feel it has become disconnected from the majority of Goodrickers, especially those who aren&#039;t first years. I also feel that the JCRC doesn&#039;t serve anyone to the degree it should - it needs to be a lot more student focused and I feel I can really deliver on that point.</p>
<p><strong>SW:</strong> Because I loved being on the JCRC the past year as Bar Rep, and I feel ready to take on a more demanding role in the committee. I think I would make an excellent chair in keeping the JCRC motivated and united. Also, I very much want to represent Goodricke College for our first full year on the new Heslington East campus.</p>
<p><strong>TE:</strong> Because I&#039;ve really enjoyed being on the JCRC this year as Bar Rep and want to be able to do even more for the college. Its been great getting positive feedback from students about Freshers&rsquo; week and other events and I want to make sure Goodrickers are getting the best events and services they can from the university, YUSU and the JCRC itself.</p>
<p><span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>:<strong> What are your main policies?</strong></p>
<p><strong>ACRC:</strong> Firstly, I want to make the JCRC a lot more open to the students&rsquo; views. I aim to create an online forum where they can contact me with regards to their problems &amp; issues, and where they can vote and give their opinion on decisions the JCRC has recently made. Secondly, I want to make Goodrickers&rsquo; lives easier on the new campus. Whilst it may be really nice being on the new campus, I understand that it is a difficult task to get to lectures and many events on the main campus, and to get into York easily. I want to work hard to get better transport links, greater links with the other colleges and ultimately a better connection with the main campus. My aim for the JCRC is to make it work for the members of the college. It needs to be a lot more open and democratic throughout the year, and not just for the election fortnight. I would also try to change the perspective of the JCRC. I want to bring new ideas to the JCRC and hopefully help maximise what is already going on in the college to help benefit Goodricke students as best as possible.</p>
<p><strong>SW:</strong> I want to lobby the university and YUSU into giving us the services we are entitled to. This includes a cash point and a more reliable bus service. Also, I am hoping to bring Goodricke a major event that would rival the likes of James Quad Dash, using the huge amount of outdoor space we now have on the new campus. I will aim to make sure all the roles work together and keep the sub-committees we developed this year. I wouldn&#039;t change much about the JCRC, I think it works well with the roles we currently have, I would just hope to keep it from fragmenting and make sure it provides the college with the best year it has had yet.</p>
<p><strong>TE:</strong> JCRC Openness- a visible, accessible and approachable JCRC, not a closed-off clique. I will provide minutes, termly budget reports and a regularly updated blog for the Chair and JCRC. I will lobby the university to secure a cashpoint on Heslington East as soon as possible. If we stop asking we won&#039;t be getting! I will also negotiate a deal with the university so that next year porters will be in the Hub during the day but will return to the nucleus for the evenings and nights. I intend to ensure the continuation of the free bus service next year and push First for a reliable evening and weekend timetable. I will look into securing a temporary alcohol license to allow the selling of alcohol at JCR events at Heslington East as well. Also, I&#039;m thinking Picnic Benches outside the common rooms, covered smoking areas and barbeques. Let&#039;s make Goodricke even more sociable!</p>
<p><span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>: <strong>What do you think of the competition?</strong></p>
<p><strong>ACRC:</strong> The competition for chair is really competitive this year &amp; everyone has great points to their campaign.</p>
<p><strong>SW:</strong> Competition is extremely strong, as I am running against my fellow Bar Rep, Tim Ellis. I know he knows just as much as I do about the college. From hustings, I learnt that the other two male candidates have good policies and that whoever wins this year will be determined to give the college another amazing year.</p>
<p><strong>TE:</strong> The three other potential chairs are all going to be hard competition. Danny and Alex have been viewed as outsiders but they&#039;ve got some great ideas and seem very committed to Goodricke. I know Sophie from working alongside her as a Bar Rep over the last year and know how much she has put into the committee over the last year.</p>
<p><span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>: <strong>What gives you an edge over them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>ACRC:</strong> I have not been on the JCRC before and so can bring new ideas and a new approach to how we should run this committee! Also, as a second year I have experienced a year of Goodricke and I have seen the positives and negatives of the way the JCRC has been run. This will allow me to bring my own approach in dealing with the issues so we don&#039;t have the same problems again</p>
<p><strong>SW:</strong> The fact that I am a woman, the fact that I have a woman&rsquo;s touch on everything. Goodricke needs refinement and a slightly bossy attitude to make sure that it gets everything it deserves. Also, working on the JCRC over the past year as the only girl Bar Rep, I have worked closely with the Chair and with various roles on the committee to bring the college various events and activities. I played a key role in the organisation of Freshers&rsquo; week and have strong regular attendance at meetings.</p>
<p><strong>TE:</strong> I have the experience, the dedication and the commitment that being a College Chair needs. I&#039;ve been over at Heslington East a silly amount over the last term, talking to students and getting to know them. I&#039;ve learnt what they want and I want to be able to put things into action. Being Goodricke Chair is a huge job and I know how much work is required to be effective, having worked alongside Dan Walker over the last year. I know I can put the 100% that is needed into it and make next year the best possible year for Goodricke students!</p>
<p><span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>:<strong> Taglines or Mascots?</strong></p>
<p><strong>ACRC:</strong> Most people know me as Christopher Robin. If you don&#039;t know who Christopher Robin is he is the boy who owns Winnie the Pooh. I feel he is a perfect character to show what sort of chair I would want to be. He has the enthusiasm I would use to represent students as a member of this college. He has the understanding that I would use to always be open to problems and opinions. And he has the imagination that I would use to think of new ideas and take this JCRC in a different direction for Goodrickers&rsquo; benefit.</p>
<p><strong>SW:</strong> SuperSoph- Reign of Tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>TE:</strong> George The Goodricke Lion! Goodricke needs a big furry mascot to represent us at events and matches!</p>
<p>Voting closes on Sunday. Visit http://www.yusu.org/election/voting to make sure the best man (or superwoman) gets the job.</p>
