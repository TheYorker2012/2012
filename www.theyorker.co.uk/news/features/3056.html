		<div class="SubText">Have you ever kissed someone and then forgotten their name? Or worse, kissed someone without even asking their name? Ever played that game where you try to kiss as many people as possible in one night? Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ve all done it. Or have we?</div>

        <p>A student from South East Asia once inquired &ndash; after fastidiously observing a particularly debauched Wednesday in Ziggy&#039;s &ndash; what it means to kiss someone in Britain? And this proved a difficult question to answer. It was concluded that a lot of the time, kissing is quite meaningless.</p>
<p>Font of wisdom Wikipedia defines kissing in Western cultures as: &ldquo;An expression of romantic affection or sexual desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, this definition seems off target. Has drunkenly kissing some sweaty stranger on a night out anything to do with romantic affection or sexual desire?</p>
<p>Whilst it would be an injustice to presume all of Britain to be smacker happy, tonsil tennis champions, it is nonetheless disquieting to think that the act of kissing someone is so often entirely removed from romance or sexual attraction, whilst in many other countries the situation is quite different.</p>
<p>This aforementioned South East Asian student said that where she comes from it is normal to wait weeks or months to kiss someone, even when in an official relationship, and that, as a girl in her twenties, she has many friends who are yet to experience their first kiss. Whilst kissing before dating is not unheard of, she said that it is not really spoken of. Kissing when not in a relationship is seen as &ldquo;slutty&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We asked this student, and another from Cyprus, whether they know people in their countries who have kissed more than ten people. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; was the answer from the South East Asian student; she had heard of people having kissed about five, although no one she knew directly. The Cypriot student said that she had quite a few friends who were more liberal with their lips, but only really since they&rsquo;d come to study in Britain.</p>
<p>It seemed pointless to ask any English students whether they knew people who had kissed more than ten people. However, all those who were willing to respond to the question, &ldquo;Have you kissed ten or more people?&rdquo; answered in the affirmative, and these were not people chosen for their notorious harlotry.</p>
<p>But what do the men have to say about all this? A male Turkish student compared his pulling methods in England with his methods at home.</p>
<p>About the English he said:
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to do any work. Even the cheesiest lines will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And about the Turkish:
&ldquo;You could maybe find a girl to kiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This student admitted to having kissed up to four girls on a night out in England, but only ever one in Turkey. And it seems we make this libertine loving quite possible.</p>
<p>He made the point that less is more in England, in that the more you try to talk to the girl, the more you are procrastinating the passion: &ldquo;The more you talk to a girl, the less she wants you.&rdquo; This seems to say a lot about our attitudes to kissing. The wish to get to know a nice guy, and maybe end up kissing him, and the wish to just kiss someone &ndash; anyone! &ndash; are apparently two very different wishes.</p>
<p>Thinking back to the idea that a kiss is &ldquo;an expression of romantic affection or sexual desire&rdquo;, can a kiss on a night out be seen as either of these things? If it is true that conversation kills the mood, then it is surely not anything to do with romantic affection. And indeed, after a few trebles in the Nag&rsquo;s, is sexual attraction really anything to do with it either, or is just the beer goggles?</p>
<p>So what does it mean to kiss someone in Britain? Still a difficult question to answer. Having asked some British students what causes them to kiss a stranger on a night out various responses came back: &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m drunk and horny!&rdquo;, &ldquo;Because he attacked my face and I couldn&rsquo;t say no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another male student, this time British, when asked whether eye contact and dancing or pleasant conversation was the more effective pulling tactic, said: &ldquo;Chatting leads more easily to a better, more meaningful kiss, but if you want a relatively quick pull dancing is better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why we ever want a &ldquo;quick pull&rdquo; when we know it&rsquo;s just because we&rsquo;re drunk, and we know we&rsquo;re never going to talk to or see this &ndash; often anonymous &ndash; person again is another quandary entirely. It seems, however, that there is something of an unwritten code in Britian. Just as our South East Asian friend told us that kissing when not dating is accepted as slutty where she comes from, here it seems we have accepted that a kiss varies in importance depending on its circumstances. Whether you&rsquo;ve had cause to thoroughly deconstruct the meaning of a kiss before or not, luckily, we  seem to know the difference between a &ldquo;quick pull&rdquo; and a meaningful kiss.</p>

<p>Well, in my experience this is hardly representative of the Cypriot population. Cyprus is more socially conservative when it comes to issues such as religion or homosexuality, but in terms of heterosexual relations its attitude is very similar to that of most other Western nations.</p>

<p>I would suggest that a fair few friends I know have been &quot;more liberal with their lips&quot; since they came to university, not since they came to the UK. And I would also suggest that anyone drunkenly kissing someone without any romantic or sexual desire is acting against the normal trend - what is the actual reason (you didn&#039;t say)?</p>
<p>Most people that I know who don&#039;t get drunk wait a little while into the relationship before kissing. Granted that at this university it&#039;s much rarer but it&#039;s still not something that is extremely odd in the UK.</p>
<p>Good article but it seems to be stereotyping various countries much more than necessary!</p>

<p>its not a night out in the UK without watching someone really attractive kissing someone really disgusting and sweaty looking in the corner of a club... speaking of which, there have been a few nights out where kissing wasn&#039;t the only thing people were doing in front of everyone!!! :(</p>

<p>There&#039;s no way of writing such an article without stereotyping... but its all quotations from people from said countries. Can hardly carry out an international census!</p>

<p>I think the author would have specified; Northern Cyprus is an occupied territory, not a recognised nation.</p>

<p>I&#039;ve heard many, many stereotypes of English girls on my gap year. German, French and Swedish girls said that English girls are &#039;easy&#039; and &#039;binge drink&#039;. Despite seeing MUCH evidence for this, I get fed up when it&#039;s always &quot;the girls are easy, they guys get what they want&quot;. The English blokes are easy. The girls get what they want. Reverse the stereotypes! If English girls are more sexually liberated (although not completely) I&#039;m proud. If sexual conservatism could go both ways, I don&#039;t mind either.</p>

<p>English born and bred and I&#039;ve kissed less than 10 people. In fact I had kissed far more away from University than at it, for whatever reason despite enjoying going out and getting tipsy I&#039;ve never felt the desire to kiss random strangers in that situation. If I met someone I was attracted to, sure, but I can&#039;t say those pop up a lot on nights out (maybe I just drink less than others?).</p>

<p>I&#039;m with #10 on that one. I don&#039;t see the point of pulling someone for the sake of pulling someone. If you&#039;re going to be initimate with someone, in that or any other way, it should be someone that you&#039;re attracted to and care about. I&#039;ve only ever pulled someone I&#039;d only just met once (post-Tru a couple of months back) and didn&#039;t enjoy it one bit, as I didn&#039;t really know her and wasn&#039;t particularly attracted to her for that reason.</p>

<p>#11 raises an interesting point. I have certainly kissed more than 10 boys, and many of them have just been the sort of club-kissing spoken about in the article, but it really does feel different to kiss someone you actually care about. The student from South East Asia has got it right it seems.<br />
And quite frankly, a lot o the kisses on nights out I have had have simply been so I&#039;ve got a story for the next day (shameful!) Ok, so I don&#039;t go about kissing anyone, but forgetting names etc yes.</p>
