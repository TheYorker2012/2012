		</div>
		<div class="SubText">GSA Press and Publicity Officer and regular Yorker blog writer Jay Walker comments on the YUSU Officer candidates&rsquo; election campaigns that have impressed him this past week.</div>

        <p>As the GSA&rsquo;s Press and Publicity Officer, I am used to trying to come up with new, innovative ways of reaching the graduate population with the GSA&rsquo;s messages, whether it is about an upcoming event or the election of new officers - the latter of which I have much experience of given the amount of elections we&rsquo;ve had this year!</p>
<p>That&#039;s why I have looked on with much interest since campaigning began at what the candidates have been up to, and it must be said, a few campaigns have particularly made an impact.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>

It must be said, a few campaigns have particularly made an impact.
<img src="../../images/prototype/news/quote_close.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
<br /><span class="author"></span>
</div></blockquote><p>Although not the most visible one in terms of sheer mass of flyers, posters, etc, <strong>Tim Ngwena</strong>&rsquo;s campaign has impressed me immensely. Wherever I look, whether it be on Facebook or walking through Vanbrugh College Reception, I have seen his little animated avatar version of himself. Quite frankly, it is one of the best bits of branding I&rsquo;ve seen in a long time, and he or whoever came up with it would make a fantastic addition to an ad agency upon graduation in my opinion.</p>
<p>Secondly, I think he conducted himself very well at hustings, coming across as very dignified and respectful towards his fellow candidates, which is always a good way of generating a good public image. Frankly, given his charisma, it&rsquo;s a shame he hasn&rsquo;t been out more campaigning, although from what he has said to me privately, much of this was down to it being the run-up to Fusion last weekend.</p>
<p></p>
<div style="float: left; width: 180px; padding: 2px"><a href="../../photos/full/3121.jpg"><img src="../../photos/medium/3121.jpg" width="180" height="145" title="Campaigning risque Special K" alt="Campaigning risque Special K"  /></a><div>&quot;I&#039;m not sure how happy Kellogg&#039;s would be with this!&quot;</div></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Rhianna Kinchin</strong> has also impressed me on a number of levels. Again, she has branded herself and her campaign well with the whole &lsquo;Vote Special K&rsquo; thing, although I&rsquo;m not sure how happy Kellogg&rsquo;s would be about this! She has also organised her campaigners very well. Getting two JCRC Chairs, both of whose physiques put my rather reasonable one to shame, to run around campus last Wednesday in purely their boxers and a big Special K symbol painted on their chests was a genius way of raising her profile and getting her message across. Her paper publicity has been very noticeable and distinctive as well, and I&#039;ve noticed it in a variety of places.</p>
<p><strong>Rory Shanks</strong>&rsquo; publicity has also caught my eye, as whilst he has run a decidedly more understated campaign than Rhianna, it has still been noticeable. Using the layout of food packaging for his posters was a brilliant idea, given that his rival candidate Rhianna is using the campaign slogan &lsquo;Vote Special K&rsquo;. It is so brilliant in fact, I wonder if Rory already had wind of what Rhianna was planning?</p>
<p></p>
<div style="float: right; width: 180px; padding: 2px"><a href="../../photos/full/3117.jpg"><img src="../../photos/medium/3117.jpg" width="180" height="145" title="campaign 2" alt="campaign 2"  /></a><div>&quot;Nothing short of fantastic&quot;</div></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Lewis Bretts</strong>&rsquo; campaign has also been very good; nothing short of fantastic in fact, and it could be argued that it has made the other candidates raise their game. Lewis&rsquo; campaign worked very well, as it has a very clear image, it has been highly visible and I think it&#039;s great that his campaign has all been about his policies.</p>
<p>I also think it&#039;s really good that Lewis has not been the only candidate whose campaign has focused on their policies. I know, for instance, I have noticed <strong>Ed Durkin</strong>&rsquo;s Monopoly-themed publicity advertising his policies on top of his big banner, specifically highlighting the bicycle rental scheme he has talked about at various hustings. The publicity of <strong>Emily Scott</strong>, <strong>Gemma Johnson</strong> and <strong>Tom Langrish</strong> has been quite good on this front as well I think.</p>
<p>Also, a word on <strong>Dave Sharp</strong>. His campaign slogan &lsquo;Fix Up. Vote Sharp&rsquo; is fantastic. It is always good to invoke prior knowledge, as it helps to make you more memorable. The stickers he has been handing out with said slogan on have also been a very good idea in my opinion, as he&rsquo;s been able to turn students into walking adverts, much like Lewis Bretts and his sandwich board!</p>
<p>In the interests of fairness, and given that I&rsquo;ve mentioned the other three Democracy and Services candidates and the high visibility of their campaigns, I think it&rsquo;s a shame that <strong>George Papadofragakis</strong>&rsquo; campaign hasn&rsquo;t been more visible. Admittedly I say this as I think he&rsquo;s as credible a candidate as the other three, and thus, it&rsquo;s a shame in my opinion that he hasn&rsquo;t raised awareness of himself, his campaign and his policies as much as the others have.</p>
<p></p>

<br /><span class="author"></span>
</div></blockquote><p>Finally, the above is not to say that the other candidates&rsquo; campaigning hasn&rsquo;t also been good, but I have a lot to say and a limited amount of words in which to say it! My best goes out to all of the candidates. Keep up the good work for these last couple of days of campaigning!</p>

<p>I don&#039;t understand how nudity is a particulary &#039;impressive&#039; or appropriate way to win students&#039; votes, let alone their respect...</p>

<p>Exactly, these types of elections are already hindered by the fcat they are lirtl emore than popularity contests and publicity stunts such as Rihanna shift whatever focus there may have been on policies to PERSONALITY.</p>
<p>In fact, what is it about Special K that makes it an adequte tool for campaigning? Yes, it means she can use old cereal boxes with her initials on them without having to get it out of her budget, therefore a judicious marketing tool, but the implications seem rather dubious from a moral or a policies pov.</p>

<ul id="CommentItem6446History" class="comment_edit"><li>Fri, 13th Mar 2009 6:13pm - Edited by the author</li></ul><p>Hi. To address the point made by post #1, George only told me that he had officially stopped campaigning on Wednesday afternoon after the blog had already been submitted. If I had already known, then of course I would have addressed it.</p>
<p>Also, post #2, at no point did I say that two JCRC Chairs running around in their boxers was &#039;impressive&#039;. I still say it was a good campaign strategy though, because regardless of if you or I (or Hannah Cann in her blog for that matter!) don&#039;t like it, sex sells and sex grabs the attention. When you&#039;re competing for the attentions of students amongst a vast pool of other candidates, you do what you have to do, and what she has done certainly has grabbed the attention!</p>
<p>Finally, Marie; &quot;it means she can use old cereal boxes with her initials on them without having to get it out of her budget&quot;. What&#039;s wrong with that then? It&#039;s meant that she&#039;s increased the amount of publicity she&#039;s had about, and good on her. Don&#039;t see what the problem is personally. Lots of other candidates have &#039;reclaimed&#039; cardboard and paper from the recycling bins to help make their budgets go further, and well done to them I say!</p>

<p>The Special K will be remembered. Personality, frankly, is very important - it&#039;s no good having a great list of policies if you&#039;re the kind of person who either lies to win or promises the world but can&#039;t deliver. Whether men running around in boxers is a fair representation of her personality I&#039;m not going to guess <img src="../../images/smileys/rasberry.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>But it gets noticed and, perhaps unfortunately, that&#039;s half of the battle.</p>

<p>I completely agree: getting noticed is obviously the key, but that&#039;s precisely the problem with the special K campaign, there is no sense of what she is campaigning for.</p>
<p>Bretts has taken the same approach with recycled cardboard etc. but has made his publicity POLICY-based, and he has been just as effective and visible without simply playing on the fact that a certain product is popular amongst female university students. Frankly, using special K is morally dubious...!</p>

<p>I do like the &quot;here is a fresh fruit and beg stall&quot; and &quot;here is the Morrisons bus&quot; trick... though I don&#039;t really think they&#039;re his most important policies. And someone else pointed out that if people just know the Special K thing and go to vote, Ella-Grace Kirton will be there to confuse them as well.</p>
<p>I don&#039;t know; there are definitely people out there who will think &quot;men running around and being silly? Pfft, student politics is pointless&quot; but maybe others will think &quot;men running around in pirate gear? Yay, student politics is a good laugh&quot; or something else entirely. It&#039;s hard to judge these things!</p>
