        <p>My coursemates are often surprised when I tell them my age. Yes, sometimes I do feel a little old. Nonetheless it&#039;s not usually a noticeable age gap; I&#039;m really only a couple of years older than most of the people in my year.</p>
<p>The reason for my (relatively) advanced age is that I had to do compulsory military service back home. In essence, I took the equivalent of three gap years - two years serving in the army, one year working and waiting for uni to start. It was a bit weird getting into academic study after three years away, although I&#039;m fully into the swing of things now.</p>
<p>Looking back, the army seems like a world away.</p>
<p>I can still remember my time in basic training vividly. We had just arrived in our bunks when a loud-voiced sergeant entered effing and blinding. Over the next few months I would learn the finer points of jungle warfare, tactical movement &ndash; and some extremely colourful swear words.</p>
<p>For most of these activities I was, to put it bluntly, terrified, with the result being that I ended up one of the worst recruits ever. Those three months were some of the worst of my life. I frequently felt stupid and useless and thought I was bringing my platoon down. If I could re-live any moment in my life I&#039;d want to go back and try and do a better job than I did when I was first there &ndash; to not wallow in self-pity; to not be so sensitive to criticism and punishment: to be more positive about the whole thing.</p>
<p>Then again, I guess it was part of a greater learning experience. I remember there was a banner that used to greet us outside the training school.  A banner telling us that the army was a place where &quot;boys would enter and men would leave&quot; or words to that effect. I don&#039;t know about whether the army made me a better person, but I certainly learned a lot about myself &ndash; not all of it positive. At least it made me want to endeavour to change.</p>
<p>And I was glad for the opportunity to meet different kinds of people; to step outside the bourgeois, middle-class bubble I had been living in for the past eighteen years. There was a silver lining at the end of basic training too: I got posted to the school of military medicine where I received formal instruction in first-aid and clinical practice.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting things I learned was how to perform intravenous injections on patients. We practiced on each other, and because of my extremely prominent veins I was a popular choice as an &quot;IV dummy&quot;. I still have numerous needle marks on both my arms, so much so that I have to occasionally explain to people that I&#039;m not actually a heroin addict. Nonetheless, I felt extremely lucky to have been assigned to a place where I could apply myself best and gain some useful skills.</p>
<p>The day I graduated and received my Red Cross insignia was one of my proudest moments ever.</p>
<p>I finished my term of service as a medical orderly, attaining the rank of Corporal. I learned many things, not just in the medical/nursing sphere but also about working with different kinds of people. Again it wasn&#039;t entirely a smooth ride, but I&#039;m grateful for the experience. At the very least it gave me time to consider my post-secondary options; I really only decided to study abroad somewhere towards the end of my first year of service.</p>
<p>I&#039;ve not yet fully paid off my debt to my country, so to speak, as I&#039;m still on the active reserve list. Since I&#039;m studying overseas, I&#039;ve been granted a disruption, but when I finish uni I&#039;m liable to be recalled for at least three weeks a year until the age of forty for refresher courses, mobilisations, field training and the like.</p>
<p>Still, my army experiences were put sharply into perspective shortly after I arrived in the UK. A young man I spoke to at a blood donation drive had recently enlisted into the TA and told me he was going to be deployed in Afghanistan after his basic training in Germany.</p>
<p>I hope my country never ever goes to war. I don&#039;t think I have the bottle to fire a rifle at someone, enemy or not, which is why I&#039;m glad that I&#039;m a medic - a healer rather than someone deployed to cause the injuries.</p>
<p>Still, I guess I&#039;ll never really know unless something awful happens.</p>

<p>I&#039;m so glad we don&#039;t have military service in this country! I&#039;m not sure how I&#039;d cope if I had to enlist but I know it would be anything but good!  Although I guess if I&#039;d been brought up to expect it, and if we weren&#039;t at war, things might be different.</p>

<p>This is such a good blog, it talks so much of issues that some of us will never experience. Such a good insight and really interesting to someone, like me, who came straight from sixth form, and in that sense has never really lived much.</p>
