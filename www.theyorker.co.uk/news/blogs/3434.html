        <p><strong>Thomas Jefferson once said that, &quot;Reason and free inquiry are the only effectual agents against error.&quot; And so, with that quote in mind, and the understanding that scientific theories must be falsifiable, the Freedom Society is hosting &#039;Climate Week&#039;, a five-day event from the 26th to 30th October at the University of York.</strong></p>
<p>The week will question the politics and ethics of climate change science. Here at the Freedom Society, we do not know if anthropogenic climate change is occurring or not, but in order for us to draw a conclusion &ndash; especially as non-scientists &ndash; it is vital that the science be liberal, objective and untainted by political pressure.</p>
<p>There have been many examples of &#039;scientific consensus&#039;. A useful illustration is the former fear of Global Cooling that gained momentum in the 1960s. The first paragraph of a New York Times article, from 30th January 1961, entitled <em>SCIENTISTS AGREE WORLD IS COLDER; But Climate Experts Meeting Here Fail to Agree on Reasons for Change</em>, read: &quot;After a week of discussions on the causes of climate change, an assembly of specialists from several continents seems to have reached unanimous agreement on only one point: it is getting colder.&quot;</p>
<p>We can claim a consensus of sorts, whether it is regarding global warming or cooling, by simply pointing to an article such as this. But this idea is terribly skewed for several reasons. By appointing a group of scientists to find evidence of something, the patron of this group will always receive reward; just as a different patron who demands his own scientists disprove this conclusion will similarly receive reward. Thus the danger of climate change science is that there is only one patron.</p>
<p>This is not how science works; instead, theories should be disproved in order to be proved - only by having free and balanced discussion will we enjoy progress. The failure of such groups as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is that they are heavily politicised.</p>
<p>There are a growing number of cries that the IPCC has negated the traditional scientific method. The climatologist Roger Pielke, despite believing in anthropogenic climate change, has criticised the IPCC for its ill-gotten conclusions and has accused the scientific body of subjectively choosing data to support a selective view of climate change science.</p>
<p>Pielke points out the systematic conflict of interest that is present in the IPCC assessment process: &quot;The same individuals who are doing primary research in the role of humans on the climate system are then permitted to lead the assessment... Assessment Committees should not be an opportunity for members to highlight their own research.&quot;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the House of Lords Economics Committee has recently stated that, &quot;We have some concerns about the objectivity of the IPCC process, with some of its emissions scenarios and summary documentation apparently influenced by political considerations.&quot;</p>
<p>The IPCC has not just become a body of political scientists, but scientific politicians as well. These people&rsquo;s professions have become adulterated with the idealism of environmental morality.</p>
<p>The 2008 International Conference on Climate Change in New York brought to light the &quot;absolute horror stories&quot; about how some scientific journals and political bodies have engaged in the suppression of climate-sceptic scientists trying to publish their work in peer-reviewed journals. This conference included many afflicted current and former IPCC scientists from all over the globe.</p>
<p>The IPCC is not the only culprit, but indeed, virtually all of the governmental and intergovernmental scientific bodies. Dr. Ferenc Miskolczi, an atmospheric physicist at NASA, resigned because of the agency&rsquo;s lack of scientific freedom.</p>
<p>Miskolczi said he wanted to publish and discuss his new research that showed &quot;runaway greenhouse theories contradict energy balance equations,&quot; but he claims that NASA refused to allow him. He recently said that, &quot;Unfortunately, my working relationship with my NASA supervisors eroded to a level that I am not able to tolerate.  My idea of the freedom of science cannot coexist with the recent NASA practice of handling new climate change related scientific results.&quot;</p>
<p>A consensus in one branch of science does not mean a consensus across all branches. For example, a recent survey of 51,000 scientists in Canada from the Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists and Geophysicists found that 68% of them disagreed with the statement that &ldquo;the debate on the scientific causes of recent climate change is settled.&rdquo; The survey also stated that only 26% of scientists attributed global warming to &quot;human activity such as burning fossil fuels.&quot;</p>
<p>And so most importantly, science is not a numbers game; rather it is the manifestation of debate and the imperative to allow dissent. There are too many examples in the history of scientific thought of a single scientist working against a &#039;consensus&#039; only to have his theories ultimately being accepted.</p>
<p>While there is no clear indication either way that this might be the case with climate change science, it becomes only too apparent that there is a desperate need for such free debate, given the drastic choices that Governments are prepared to make. Whether such decisions involve the complete overhaul of our energy sources, or the (ethically questionable) prevention of industrialisation in developing countries, the need to end scientific censorship is vitally important.</p>
<p>The problem with climate science is not actually the science itself, as so often stated by sceptics, but it is the politics and ethics. The University of York Freedom Society&#039;s &#039;Climate Week&#039; will not try to cover the complicated and vast subject of the science itself; instead it will highlight the dangers of academic suppression and weigh the ethical questions involved when dealing with such proscription.</p>
<p>A politician might argue that - assuming anthropogenic climate change is a definite threat - acting now might save millions of lives in the future; whereas Kenyan villagers - who have been refused fuel for their gas generator by some Western charities - might argue differently as the women who cook over log fires continue to painfully die at young ages from smoke-induced lung cancer.</p>
<p>Climate Week will see many scientists, politicians, journalists and environmentalists, from all over Europe and ever further afield, come together for the first time in the UK, to discuss a matter that will inevitably have a terrifying effect on the lives of us and our children.</p>
<p>Karl Popper once said that, &quot;The history of science, like the history of all human ideas, is a history of irresponsible dreams, of obstinacy, and of error. But science is one of the very few human activities &mdash; perhaps the only one &mdash; in which errors are systematically criticized and fairly often, in time, corrected. This is why we can say that, in science, we often learn from our mistakes, and why we can speak clearly and sensibly about making progress there.&quot;</p>
<p>&#039;Climate Week&#039; seeks to satisfy this fundamental pillar of scientific thought, and in October, whether we will be debating in an icy cold or a humid heat, the mere happening of debate is one of the most important steps towards preservation.</p>
