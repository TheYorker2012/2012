<h3> Defending Nadz  </h3>

<p></p>
<div style="float: right; width: 180px; padding: 2px"><a href="../../photos/full/1598.jpg"><img src="../../photos/medium/1598.jpg" width="180" height="145" title="Let me be your obama" alt="Let me be your obama"  /></a><div>Will Nadz be YOUR Obama?</div></div>
<p></p>
<p><em>Blog by Ben Wardle </em></p>
<p>I feel the need to respond to some of <a href="../soapbox/1529.html">Ryan Bennett&rsquo;s</a> comments. Ryan is entitled to his opinion and I have no qualms with saying that I am a Nadz supporter. So is Nadz &lsquo;confused over what the president&rsquo;s role is&rsquo; and promising &lsquo;change for changes sake&rsquo;? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Nadz is not a quiet Tory or a confused entertainer. Taking Viking Raid abroad is a great idea and one that a president should endorse. A good YUSU president should not be restricted to what people believe he or she is supposed to do. A good president leads and manages the Union to improve the student&rsquo;s quality of life.  That could mean the promotion of better events, well-run campaigns, improved JCRC funding and support or any number of things. Running the union is about being an effective and savvy manager. Laura has managed women&rsquo;s committee, which to her credit, she has done well and raised its profile. But let&rsquo;s be honest. Freshers&rsquo; Week, Battle of the Bands, Woodstock &ndash; this is a whole new level of management, leadership and responsibility. Having organized Goodricke College&rsquo;s Freshers&rsquo; week myself I am well aware how much work it takes and how much you learn.</p>
<p>I must admit I was very impressed with Mad Cap&rsquo;n Tom, he gave a great speech in hustings and his involvement has brought some fun to campaigns week. But his success has shown how desperately out of touch YUSU are with our students. We cannot afford another year of broken promises, a cliquey unapproachable union and a vote of no confidence. Nadz promises change that I believe makes a difference to student&rsquo;s life. Change that makes YUSU more transparent and visible to the students who elect them; change that helps us pick our modules based on the advice of our peers; and change that gives us better events. Those are the reasons why I am supporting Nadz but you all need to make up your own minds.</p>
<p>Personally I think Laura is a lovely person and a great candidate but I feel Nadz has far more management experience. But most importantly for everyone out there, VOTE!! Have a read of what they offer and if you think their polices can really be achieved and make a difference to your life then you don&rsquo;t need to listen to people like me.</p>


<h3> &quot;On the Payne Train&quot; </h3>

<p></p>
<div style="float: left; width: 180px; padding: 2px"><a href="../../photos/full/1590.jpg"><img src="../../photos/medium/1590.jpg" width="180" height="145" title="No Payne no Gain" alt="No Payne no Gain"  /></a><div>No Payne no Gain?</div></div>
<p>
<em>Blog Ellie Kuper Thomas</em></p>
<p>The last week has been a steep (and rather sleepless) learning curve. On top of the usual hectic schedule, I&rsquo;ve been helping Laura with her presidential campaign. After an off-hand remark &ndash; &lsquo;oh wow, you&rsquo;re running, that&rsquo;s brilliant! Anything I can do at all to help&hellip;&rsquo; I found myself on a whirlwind tour of postering, debates and chalking: With similar trepidation, I imagine, to Monty Python&rsquo;s Brian as he prepares to graffiti: &ldquo;Romans Go Home,&rdquo; I creep into empty lecture rooms to scrawl the legend: Payne for President. Luckily, I am not confronted by any grammar enthusiast soldiers, but I am forced to admit that it does rather look like Laura&rsquo;s supporters are a bunch of five year olds let loose with chalk&hellip;oops!</p>
<p>After an over-enthusiastic &ldquo;pirate crew-member&rdquo; mistook a board rubber for a cutlass and erased my careful chalk calligraphy I lost all composure and stormed from the lecture theatre muttering. Not so Laura, faced with any adversity: disappearing banners, carefully blue-tacked posters being calmly pulled down by cleaners, She remains calm, cheery and tracks down the right authority to solve the problem. She charms porters into tracking down the banner and sweetly explains to the cleaners that &lsquo;there is meant to be a bit of an amnesty this week on posters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same when faced with the baleful stares of apathetic students, who, if they have any idea of the election, think it&rsquo;s something to do with pirates fighting gladiators. Or, if more informed, actually think it&rsquo;s a great idea to pay thousands of pounds, of our money, to a candidate who seems to think it&rsquo;s one big joke. She simply sits down and clearly explains her policies, listens to their complaints, suggests solutions and generally presents herself as a keen listener with the ability to get things done.</p>
<p>At the end of this exhausting week, when I am frankly glad to be at home, far from the sight of a pirate or a poster, I am amazed by Laura&rsquo;s energy &ndash; as I crawl out of bed (10am) and check my emails I&rsquo;ll have had at least one warm, funny and enthusiastic email from Laura&hellip;sent at 2.30am.  As I&rsquo;ve trawled in Laura&rsquo;s wake this week my initial impression of her has been continuously enforced. I met Laura when I attended my first women&rsquo;s committee meeting: it wasn&rsquo;t my first foray into York student activism but it was the first meeting where I left feeling enthused. Ideas were discussed, action planned, schedules made. I felt that not only was the committee full of great ides but that they were practical, and moreover would take place! And driving this, not in an aggressive or controlling way but with enthusiasm, advice, knowledge and co-operation: Laura Payne.</p>
<p>This is why I feel Laura will make a brilliant YUSU president. She comes from (in my opinion) the best side of the union &ndash; its welfare and support role. She knows the union inside out, and what&rsquo;s more, is still enthusiastic about it and the positive impact it can and must have on student life. This is why her policies are practical &ndash; she knows exactly what can be achieved and how. More important though than her policies, is how I feel she will run the union: slow to judge, constantly wishing to know more, wanting to help, enthusiastic and approachable  &ndash; if anyone can break open the much discussed YUSU clique, it&rsquo;s her.  So &lsquo;No Payne, No Gain&rsquo; really is more than a slogan: this year York students have the ability to vote for a candidate who really can bring YUSU closer and more relevant to us.</p>


<h3> &quot;Defending the Mad Cap&#039;&quot; </h3>

<p></p>
<div style="float: right; width: 180px; padding: 2px"><a href="../../photos/full/1507.jpg"><img src="../../photos/medium/1507.jpg" width="180" height="145" title="Mad Captain Tom" alt="Mad Captain Tom"  /></a><div>Actually Competent?</div></div>
<p></p>
<p><em>Blog by Persephone Cara Hallow</em></p>
<p>What do you get if you take a three-pointed hat, an eye patch and a duck called Brian? Well, either the start to a terrible joke or to a really rather good one &ndash; the one and only pirate presidential candidate, Mad Cap&#039;n Tom.</p>
<p>His shirt billows like the sails of his cherished ship, The Golden Duck, his voice booming loud and hoarse across the lake as he sails the eight colleges of York. Gaping mouths and incredulous looks meet the sight of a pirate, glasses over his eye patch, in the running for the head of YUSU. Yet there is one element that unites every response the Cap&#039;n receives: confusion.</p>
<p>Why is he doing this? Will there really be discount rum in campus bars? And is it all just a big joke?
The best response I noticed, whilst wading through seas of pirate-speak posted on the wall of his Facebook group (&ldquo;1,000 Strong for Mad Cap&#039;n Tom: We Want a Pirate SU President&rdquo;) was this treasure:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&#039;ve got the public vote, but tone it down a bit! You don&#039;t want people thinking its a big joke and you aren&#039;t taking it seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, is the Cap&#039;n really a serious candidate? Answer: yes and no.</p>
<p>The man behind the cutlass, Education MA student Tom Scott, is certainly up to the task of running the SU, and will do a fine job if elected. He has experience as a society chair, has been with the university long enough to know all its workings, runs the British part of International Talk Like a Pirate Day and evidently has a sense of humour. However, his pirate persona is neither a gimmick to win more votes nor a guise which will be dropped should he be elected. Mad Cap&#039;n Tom is running because, well, it sounded like a fun way to spend a couple of weeks. If he gets in as well, so be it.
The Cap&#039;n and his crew of mad buccaneers have been campaigning with some true style. Cue a porters&#039; trolley dressed up as his vessel, The Golden Duck, an army of sword-wielding campaigners and the theme tune to &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean&rdquo; blaring, as the definition of the word &ldquo;swashbuckling&rdquo; is brought to life. Some would say the &ldquo;actually competent&rdquo; message is somewhat down-played at this point, but judging by the frequency of the camera flash, the Mad Cap&#039;n&#039;s presence made quite a splash.
But back to reality &ndash; if elected, what does the Cap&#039;n intend to do? Are we really going to see canons decorating the balcony of Central Hall? Is it the fate of uni admin staff to walk the plank?</p>
<p>Essentially, Mad Cap&#039;n Tom will provide the university with a President who knows what he&#039;s talking about, who is up to date on current university news (as proved at the PEP debate &ndash; and his well-received guest appearance on &ldquo;Have I Got News For York&rdquo;) and who is determined to represent the views of students to the best of his ability &ndash; even if he isn&#039;t sure that he wants to. Mad Cap&#039;n Tom: possibly the sanest vote there is.</p>

<p>I think canons decorating Central Hall would be against human rights laws. Cannons would be a better bet. <img src="../../images/smileys/wink.gif" alt="" /></p>
