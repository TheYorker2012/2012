        <p><strong>BIG D?
&lsquo;You need to get yours!
They sold out in under an hour last year?!
It&rsquo;s the biggest campus event of the year - you have to go!
Everybody goes!&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>When I arrived home after my 9.15 (groan) last Friday, I was very surprised to see my entire house up when I got back from campus at 11.30am. Unless the fire alarm had been set off or the landlord was making a visit, it was very surprising to see them all up before midday if they didn&rsquo;t have to be on campus (the joys of being art students).  It was especially weird when they were all sitting around the table watching the clock. Just as I was wondering if they&rsquo;d all gone a bit mental - they were talking about painting themselves green &ndash; I remembered: Big D tickets were going on sale at noon.</p>
<p>Remember the hype last year?  This was the one &ldquo;must go to&rdquo; campus event held in week 10.  Everyone wanted to finish the year on a high &ndash; and this year is no different. Missing out last year on the Wonderland theme (because I&rsquo;d already had a holiday booked) and hearing that it was &ldquo;amazing&rdquo; from everyone that went, all six of us were determined to get a ticket to this year&rsquo;s &ldquo;SinneD&rdquo; to finish our second year in style.</p>
<p>I have to admit that although there was such a large hype, I ignored my housemate&rsquo;s warning that if you didn&rsquo;t log on at 12, you could be there for a very long time and may miss out on buying one.  1500 tickets? Gone in under an hour? Surely that was just an exaggeration. Many people would forget, still recovering from Gallery or be in lectures.</p>
<p>So, logging on at five past 12, I was surprised how wrong I was.
I was informed that Your Shop was &ldquo;too busy to deal with your request, please try again later&rdquo;. Thinking it was just my computer being a pain I hit refresh. And again... and again. Wondering if it was just me who had this problem I consulted the source of all answers: Facebook.</p>
<p>It seemed we were not alone. Buying tickets seemed to be on every York students&#039; status with &lsquo;is wondering why they can&rsquo;t get tickets grrrr&rsquo;, &lsquo;better be going to Big D&rsquo; &lsquo;WHY ISN&rsquo;T IT WORKING!?&rsquo; as some of the statuses coming up on my newsfeed. Everyone seemed to already be one of the deadly sins &ndash; Anger &ndash; as no one seemed to be getting through. It turned my once calm housemates into crazed creatures hunched over their laptops repeatedly hitting the refresh button over and over again.</p>
<p>After 2 hours of hitting refresh and generally getting a bit sick with the Internet crashing, I wondered whether there was really no chance of getting a ticket and whether it was actually worth the &pound;23. Maybe it was better to give up before getting repetitive strain injury with clicking the mouse so many times. Maybe this was a little crazy in that I should be doing something more productive with my time i.e. my degree.
Some people would say we were crazy for sitting there for 2 hours, yet I knew others who frantically found every single Internet resource including borrowed laptops and iPhones, which could seem a little extreme in spending a whole afternoon just to buy a ticket for an event happening in six weeks.</p>
<p>All was not lost though, as just as I was beginning to lose all hope, we were lucky and we all somehow managed to get though to buy a ticket.</p>
<p>Two and a bit hours after logging on to get one.
Other students were not so lucky and missed out. Yet was it really worth it?</p>
<p>I reckon so.</p>
<p>Yes, &pound;23 is a lot of money for a student &ndash; but it&rsquo;s the last week of the summer term. Exams and essays will be over for most of us, and it raises a lot of money for charity. Headlined by the Audio Bullys and Chase &amp; Status with performances by Reverend Soundsystem, a DJ set from Reverend and the Makers, True Ingredients, Breakz and others, it seems as though there is a lot of quality acts for the money. There is also a laser tent, food stalls and an inflatable human football table all set up amongst Langwith and Derwent Colleges. Combining this with 1500 of fellow students dressed up as the deadly sins &ndash; so guaranteed to see fat suits, green paint and lots of people I know, before breaking up for the summer, the two frustrating hours I spent at my laptop is forgotten with the excitement of looking forward to what should be an amazing day on Thursday week 10.</p>
