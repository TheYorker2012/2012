		</div>
		<div class="SubText">So it&rsquo;s December, and the completely random and arbitrary ban on Christmas music that all my friends have imposed on me has thankfully been lifted. Great! Except...I don&rsquo;t want to listen to Christmas music. There&rsquo;s enough of it in the shops already, and on my last visit to Willow there was a massive, half-crazed attempt at &lsquo;jiving&rsquo; to Mariah Carey&rsquo;s &lsquo;All I Want For Christmas Is You&rsquo;. Complete with faux-snow. Like most things in the Willow, it wasn&rsquo;t very pretty.</div>

        <p>But anyway, yes it&rsquo;s a bit weird. There&rsquo;s really only been one song that has been on repeat on my ipod over the few days of apocalyptic, snowy weather &ndash; Bonnie Tyler&rsquo;s classic 1983 hit &lsquo;Total Eclipse of the Heart&rsquo;. Okay, so maybe it&rsquo;s got something to do with my friend&rsquo;s constant singing of it during a pub lunch after yet another lecture on James Joyce. Apparently it&rsquo;s some kind of sports anthem now. The real reason, however, is quite simple. I just love the song so much.</p>
<p>I first heard &lsquo;Total Eclipse of the Heart&rsquo; at the age of six. My dad had just got a new company car and it came with a CD player (as opposed to the cassette tapes which I was used to). Bonnie Tyler was track #13 or something on a love songs compilation thing that I found in the glove compartment. Mundanely, I didn&rsquo;t fall in love immediately. No, I had to wait nearly ten years, when I was undergoing an ironic hipster phase. I say this rather shame-facedly, because of how utterly silly it all was. I wanted to be the cool anti-cool kid, the bloke who proclaimed his cultural superiority over others through copious watching of French films he didn&rsquo;t understand and through listening to stuff no one else was listening to. Thus, this translated not only into an appreciation for things like Neutral Milk Hotel, but also for a lot of naff, cheesy dance-pop. A lot of the kids at school were into things like Linkin Park because they had loads of guitars and angst, and I consciously listened to things that were the direct opposite. And so it was that I discovered Nicki French&rsquo;s Euro-dance cover of &lsquo;Total Eclipse of the Heart&rsquo;, playing on the radio one day. It was a perfect symbol of my one-man resistance against conformity. If I could have had an annoying &lsquo;ironic&rsquo; haircut I would have got one, except my school didn&rsquo;t allow it.</p>
<p>Looking back, I&rsquo;m lucky to have left school with any friends at all.</p>
<p>Of course, later I grew up and discovered that in my little bourgeois bubble I was rebelling against nothing, that I was in fact quite privileged, and making mix CDs featuring Kylie, the Smiths and Argentine rock group Attaque 77 all at once and foisting them onto my unsuspecting friends didn&rsquo;t make me cooler than the next guy, it just made me look a bit sad. And so I learned to lighten up, stopped being a prat and began enjoying music for reasons other than being part of some kind of imaginary cultural hierarchy.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, despite these epiphanies, &lsquo;Total Eclipse of the Heart&rsquo; remained strong in my heart, perhaps even more so than before. I&rsquo;d moved past Nicki French by this stage and learned to love the original, with Tyler&rsquo;s throaty wail and Bruce Springsteen&rsquo;s bandmates producing the loudest, most bombastic sound possible behind her. I think my favourite bit is right after the first chorus when Max Weinberg&rsquo;s drums kick in for the instrumental break. I don&rsquo;t know what the technical drum term is, nor do I care, but it&rsquo;s a massive sound, like a cannonball. Or indeed, the explosion of the powder keg that had hitherto been giving off sparks.</p>
<p>Either way it&rsquo;s a song that I have both laughingly sung along to with friends and, rather embarrassingly, one that I&rsquo;ve played after I&rsquo;ve had my heart broken. It&rsquo;s a song with so many associations for me, both joyous and painful, and I can&rsquo;t think of any other piece of music that is more fitting to soundtrack the beauty, sadness, laughter, and even this incomparably crappy cold caused by the snowfall.</p>
