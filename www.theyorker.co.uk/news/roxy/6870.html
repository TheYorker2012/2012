		<div class="SubText">I hate stupid people. There I said it. Now go on a rant about how much of a horrible person I am; how people aren&rsquo;t stupid, they&rsquo;re just different. About how in love with myself I am &ndash; there is no need; we all know it&rsquo;s true.</div>

        <p>But as I sit here typing this, I am sat across from the most annoying and aggravating woman I have ever met. It took me a while to realise what it was about her that grated on me &ndash; it wasn&rsquo;t my usual &lsquo;oh look, a person I&rsquo;ve never met before, I shall hate them unconditionally until they prove themselves to me&rsquo; routine.</p>
<p>Was it the way she insisted on wearing Topshop everything, even though she must be kicking 40? (When I spoke to my mum about this we agreed Topshop + Over 25 = Bad). Was it the way she was overly nice? Was it her annoying little-girl telephone voice that made me want to shove the phone down her throat?</p>
<p>To be fair, it was partly because I&rsquo;ve been sat in an office for the last couple of weeks, staring at a computer, and doing 9-5 days, but that couldn&rsquo;t have been all.</p>
<p>And then it came to me; she annoys me because she is stupid. Not stupid in a way where someone might stupidly forget to record that-show-I-adore on Sky+. Not stupid in the way that I&rsquo;ll probably make a few grammatical errors in this piece (that I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be helpful in pointing them out for me if I do). Not even stupid in the way that if I asked her what Pi was she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to recite the whole thing in 2 seconds flat &ndash; although I highly doubt she <em>could</em> do that.</p>
<p>No. She was just really stupid. As in, I&rsquo;ve spent my day showing her how to use the scanner, again and again. She even took notes on how to use it, and then forgot again - I guess her notes didn&rsquo;t have enough pretty diagrams to keep her entertained.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s driving me crazy. In fact, it&rsquo;s always driven me crazy.</p>
<p>When I was in high school, I refused to listen to any of my teachers because I realised at that point that I was smarter than them. Even in primary school, it was a case of just playing by their rules, doing what they wanted, and then going home and bitching about them to my mother. I was ten forchristsake! Surely that wasn&rsquo;t supposed to happen?</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;ve never understood it because I&rsquo;ve always just assumed that people have some sort of capacity to be smart. I think it used to annoy me when I thought people were faking dumb for popularity, or to get boys to like them. Now I&rsquo;m pretty sure that some of them probably were just really, really dumb.</p>
<p>And it begs the question &ndash; how can people be <em>that</em> naturally stupid? I&rsquo;m assuming I didn&rsquo;t come out of the womb quoting Shakespeare (although sometimes I think this may be the case), but even at a young age I developed a love of books. My first words were &lsquo;read it&rsquo; &ndash; not the conventional &lsquo;mama&rsquo; or &lsquo;dada&rsquo; &ndash; obviously I cared more about inanimate objects than those slaves forced to read book after book to me (my parents).</p>
<p>Maybe there is the answer &ndash; my parents. They would read to me, they would give me educational toys, and play educational games in the car. They&rsquo;d have maths tapes on to entertain us over long journeys, and we&rsquo;d do them. We weren&rsquo;t forced to do them; my mum didn&rsquo;t tie me to the kitchen table until I&rsquo;d done my homework, because she didn&rsquo;t have to. I&rsquo;d get home, pull out my homework and go to town on that bad boy. And once I was done? I&rsquo;d grab my brothers, and do his as well.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder, are some people just born smart and some not? I can&rsquo;t for a second believe this. I&rsquo;m not talking book smart - I&rsquo;m pretty sure anyone can grab GCSE&rsquo;s if they open a book once in their lives - I&rsquo;m talking having sense, I&rsquo;m talking about not having to write down every little detail of your life on pieces of paper because you forget things, and then forgetting where you put those pieces of paper.</p>
<p>Either way, stupid people annoy me and always will. Say what you want, because you&rsquo;re all intelligent people - I hate you for other reasons, not because you&rsquo;re stupid &ndash; but I simply do not understand it. Just don&rsquo;t be all, &lsquo;I worked hard to get here and it was difficult&rsquo; because, guess what, I worked my ass off to get into this university, that doesn&rsquo;t mean I am stupid, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you are stupid.  I reckon effort is only part of the answer.</p>

			<p>Having read most of your blogs, I am having terrible trouble believing that you were smarter than your teachers.  By the way.  Unless a semicolon is being used as a separation tool in a list of phrases (the function a comma plays in a list of single words) it must also be capable of being a full stop.  In other words, what comes before and after a semicolon must both be capable of being a sentence.  In addition both parts must be so related in meaning that a full stop would seem redundant or obtrusive to meaning.  Examples:</p>
<p>Girls are creative; boys are destructive.<br />
Wales is small country; the Welsh suffer from a small country inferiority complex.</p>
<p>It can&#039;t be used in any other way.  Perhaps you should not have refused to listen to your English teacher on the assumption you were smarter than he or she was?</p>

<p>How about doing some work instead of writing your uni blog?  I bet Mrs Topshop- Can&#039;tscan is more use to the company than you are!  It&#039;s bad enough these blogs getting on Yorker in the first palce without knowing some poor sod is paying for you to write them!</p>

<p>You realised you were smarter than your primaryschool teachers? Sorry but this combined with your &#039;older men&#039; piece just shows you up for a typical university girl with a superiority complex the size of Jupiter. Your sense of smug is palpable from here.</p>

<ul id="CommentItem11183History" class="comment_edit"><li>Sat, 16th Apr 2011 6:29pm - Edited by the author</li></ul><p>Pleeease don&#039;t use the grocer&#039;s apostrophe!  It makes me die inside.  The plural for GCSE is GCSEs.  Apostrophes are used to show omission (can&#039;t, don&#039;t) or for the genetive (the &#039;possessive&#039; apostrophe).  As neither applies in your sentence - you are simply pluralising GCSE - there is no need for an apostrophe.  This stuff is so simple.  More so, I&#039;ll wager, than that tricksy office scanner and MUCH more likely to cause irritation if messed up.</p>

<p>I think ignorance is worse than stupidity. And the way this piece is written really doesn&#039;t build much of a case for you being *so* intelligent and worthy of making this statement. Please just write this stuff in a diary - I think everyone would be better off.<br />
I also echo all the grammar mistakes everyone&#039;s pointed out so far - as I said, ignorance is worse than stupidity. And your last paragraph doesn&#039;t make *any* sense.</p>

<p>&quot;Even in primary school, it was a case of just playing by their rules, doing what they wanted, and then going home and bitching about them to my mother.&quot;</p>
<p>You had to play by their rules because you were a child who probably didn&#039;t know what you were talking about. Not smart enough to realise that, were you?</p>
<p>&quot;...I&rsquo;m talking having sense, I&rsquo;m talking about not having to write down every little detail of your life on pieces of paper...&quot;</p>
<p>Given that this blog is often criticised for its meandering and narcissistic character, as well as its frequent spelling and grammar mistakes and a lack of basic sense, I&#039;m guessing that was self-satire. At least, I hope so.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I wouldn&#039;t be so convinced of your own intelligence unless you&#039;re about to receive a Double-Starred First in Mathematical Physics and Analytical Philosophy or something. There are plenty of people out there who may view you as a bit thick, so displaying some humility often goes a long way.</p>

<p>&quot;When I was in high school, I refused to listen to any of my teachers because I realised at that point that I was smarter than them. Even in primary school, it was a case of just playing by their rules, doing what they wanted, and then going home and bitching about them to my mother. I was ten forchristsake! Surely that wasn&rsquo;t supposed to happen?&quot;</p>
<p>Well, it sounds like you were a delightful child with an open and inquisitive mind and an easy-going temperament. You must have been an absolute pleasure to teach.</p>
<p>Out of interest, have you already elected to not listen to your university lecturers on the grounds that you believe you&#039;re smarter than them?</p>

<p>Roxy, you paint this (untrue) image of yourself as some  attractive, metro-modern woman, doing exciting things, being &#039;controversial&#039;, sleeping with guys left right and centre, being fun and sexy. I guess you&#039;re trying to make yourself seem more interesting in your internet persona than you actually are. And I guess you take pleasure from seeing debate spur from your &#039;edgy&#039; topics because you&#039;re so different and above us minions who sit here squabbling over your wild ways.<br />
However, your poor writing has finally overtaken the content of your articles in creating the comments. For someone that obviously writes to try and be interesting, to have the obviously argument provoking topic overshadowed by the fact that it is just bad writing is kind of embarrassing, surely? This seems like it&#039;s trying to be insulting, or out there, or whatever but it doesn&#039;t even make sense! Please stop, now.</p>

<p>If a piece on whether some girl thought everyone was stupid was exceptionally well written it might cause me to care about the subject matter.  But this is such dreadful writing.

<p>&#039;Not even stupid in the way that if I asked her what Pi was she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to recite the whole thing in 2 seconds flat&#039;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, had you listened to your teachers in high school, you might have learnt that &pi; is an irrational number. Since you were (understandably) reflecting on your own brilliance when those were explained, I should probably mention that it means &pi; goes on forever. No-one can recite the whole thing in two millennia, let alone two seconds. It&#039;s an easy mistake to make, though, especially when one&#039;s mind is so keenly honed as your own.</p>
<p>I agree that all the thickos are most vexing to us educated types. Many of them have the effrontery to be poor, and often malodorous. Surely, by harnessing our collective cranial capacity, we can improvise some kind of high-efficiency death chamber and finally be rid of the menace of stupidity! One can dream.</p>

<p>Um, actually, as someone who is new to reading <span class="theyorker">the yorker</span> and has been observing the comment tirades that seem to go on here, especially on this girl&#039;s articles, I&#039;m more of the impression that these comments border on the disturbing.  Literally, I can kind of feel the world spinning as I realise the sheer amount of hate and downright, well, rudeness that you people think it&#039;s okay to throw at someone who, it seems, is having a bit of a laugh at your expense quite successfully.</p>
<p>I&#039;m still trying to get my head round this.  It&#039;s incredible.  And that&#039;s not a compliment.</p>
