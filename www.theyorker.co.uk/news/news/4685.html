        <p><strong>10:07</strong> Also a MASSIVE well done and thanks to Zahra for holding down the fort earlier last night! Toodles folks, it&#039;s sleepy time!</p>
<p><strong>10:04</strong> Okay so that break was sleep time for Chiifen.</p>
<p>But just a final wrap up!</p>
<p>With only 35 seats left to be declared, it looks to be DEFINITELY a HUNG PARLIAMENT this year with CONSERVATIVES as majority! Well done, exit polls!</p>
<p>Current results:</p>
<p>Conservatives: 290
Labour:247
Lib Dems:51</p>
<p>Well, that&#039;s it from this blog folks! Hope you guys enjoyed it, slept a little as well! I know I&#039;m going back to bed!</p>
<p><strong>05:14</strong> Right, <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span> is going to take a break now, but we&#039;ll be back!</p>
<p>Results so far:</p>
<p>Cons: 232
La: 177
LD:36
Recap:</p>
<p>Some unexpected wins and losses here and there.</p>
<p>Disappointing results for Lib Dems, as Cleggmania clearly did not translate into votes.</p>
<p>There&#039;s serious unrest and dissatisfaction among voters who were turned away and not allowed to vote earlier today.</p>
<p>York Outer goes to Conservatives with a narrow win over Lib Dems.</p>
<p>Finally, a hung parliament seems imminent, with Conservatives as majority and Labour coming second.</p>
<p>Till we blog again, good night! Or shall I say, good morning!</p>
<p><strong>05:03</strong> Results update, with 457 seats counted</p>
<p>Cons:226
La:169
LD:36</p>
<p><strong>05:01</strong> Debates made everything &quot;topsy turvy&quot; for Cons, apparently.</p>
<p><strong>04:58</strong> Still impossible to say who will be Prime Minister, but hung parliament definite.</p>
<p><strong>04:56</strong> I hear birds chirping. It is getting late, or should I say, early?</p>
<p><strong>04:54</strong> Norwich South goes to Lib Dems!</p>
<p><strong>04:52</strong> Labour&#039;s Ed Ball holds Morley and Outwood.</p>
<p><strong>04:51</strong> Ex YUSU president Tom Scott does not win Westminster &amp; City of London. Surprise surprise.</p>
<p><strong>04:48</strong> Results update:</p>
<p>Cons:209
Labour:155
LD:31</p>
<p>Conservatives closing in steadily on the 326 seat needed to win!</p>
<p><strong>04:44</strong> Tories gain Pudsey from Labour, on quite a roll here aren&#039;t they?</p>
<p><strong>04:43</strong> Cons hit the 200 mark and continue to widen their lead.</p>
<p><strong>04:39</strong> Jacqui Smith accepts her loss gracefully.</p>
<p><strong>04:39</strong> Dewsbury goes to Cons, a swing of 5.9 % from La to Cons.</p>
<p><strong>04:37</strong> Jacqui Smith, plagued with porn rumours loses her seat to the Cons.</p>
<p><strong>04:36</strong> Right, getting quite tired now, sorry folks if updates become less frequent from now on!</p>
<p><strong>04:33</strong> Results update:</p>
<p>Cons: 187
La: 145
LD: 28</p>
<p><strong>04:31</strong> And York Outer is taken by Conservatives!</p>
<p><strong>04:29</strong> Voters themseves to be blamed for being turned away, apparently.</p>
<p><strong>04:29</strong> Oxford West and Abingdon taken from Lib Dems by the Cons.</p>
<p><strong>04:21</strong> 175 seats to Cons now, and the margin continues to widen.</p>
<p>Prediction anyone? Will Cons gain 326 seats for the win or will this year see a hung parliament ?</p>
<p><strong>04:20</strong> Swindon South goes to Conservatives.</p>
<p><strong>04:19</strong> Lib Dems and Conservative going head to head for York Outer.</p>
<p><strong>04:16</strong> Results Update:</p>
<p>Con: 168
La: 132
LD: 26</p>
<p><strong>04:14</strong> This has just been described as &quot;the strangest election&quot; ever. My first, so I&#039;ll have to take the BBC&#039;s word for it.</p>
<p><strong>04:12</strong> Lib Dems failure being discussed.</p>
<p><strong>04:10</strong> Atmosphere in Leeds is tense apparently ! Recount probable.</p>
<p><strong>04:08</strong> It seems unlikely that any party will get the 326 seats needed for a win. Hung parliament here we come!</p>
<p><strong>04:07</strong> Results are shown on the Big Ben, very majestic.</p>
<p><strong>04:06</strong> It has been highlighted by the Times that Britain now has its first two female Asian MPs. Wooh! Some Asian pride going on here.</p>
<p><strong>04:04</strong> Wyre Forest results, Mark Garnier of Conservatives win.</p>
<p><strong>04:02</strong> Recount may be apparent in Southhampton, which is traditionally a Labour seat.</p>
<p><strong>04:01</strong> Results Update:</p>
<p>Conservatives:150
Labour: 121
Lib Dems: 23</p>
<p><strong>04:00</strong> If Labour and Lib Dems were to join forces, they may form a &quot;coalition of losers&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>03:58</strong> Recap on York:</p>
<p>York Central is won by Labour.
Yorkshire East taken by Conservatives, along with Richmond Yorks.</p>
<p>No results in for York Outer.</p>
<p><strong>03:53</strong> Lib Dems win Redcar!</p>
<p><strong>03:52</strong> Labour holds Rochdale, despite &quot;Bigotgate&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>03:51</strong> To recap:</p>
<p>Exit polls predict hung parliament.</p>
<p>With 294 seats declared, Conservatives are in the lead, followed by Labour and Lib Dems, who are trailing the first two by a huge margin, much to Clegg&#039;s disappointment.</p>
<p><strong>03:48</strong> Conservatives widen their lead on Labour, with 133 to 114 respectively.</p>
<p><strong>03:46</strong> Alistair Darling currently talking to the BBC. He says there is still no &quot;clear picture of how the House of Commons will look like&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>03:43</strong> Carlisle goes to the Conservatives&#039; Andrew John Stevenson, a swing from Labour to Conservatives of 7.7 %.</p>
<p><strong>03:41</strong> BBC analyst Prof John Curtis described this elections as a &quot;cliffhanger&quot;</p>
<p><strong>03:40</strong> Angry &quot;turned-away&quot; voter just declared Afghan elections better than Britains.</p>
<p><strong>03:39</strong> Declaration: Labour government has lost their mandate to govern the country.</p>
<p><strong>03:37</strong> Nick Clegg is &quot;scarpering&quot;, according to BBC.</p>
<p><strong>03:36</strong> Lib Dems gain Burnley from Labour.</p>
<p><strong>03:31</strong> Grace fancies Miliband. Va va voom. Most interesting information I&#039;ve got thus far tonight.</p>
<p><strong>03:29</strong> Nick Clegg in car in Sheffield. Big news.</p>
<p><strong>03:28</strong> Conservatives have officially overtaken Labour at 104 to 100.</p>
<p><strong>03:26</strong> Miliband apparently slipped on air his reluctance to talk to Naughtie. Poor Naughtie. Poor Radio 4.</p>
<p><strong>03:25</strong> Grace Redheadd has just informed me that David Miliband has just insulted James Naughtie on Radio 4.</p>
<p><strong>03:20</strong> Conservative and Labour parties now tied at 92 each !</p>
<p><strong>03:11</strong> Question: Will Gordon Brown stand down and let someone else take over as leader of the Labour party?</p>
<p><strong>03:10</strong> John Simpson talking to the BBC from the airplane. Is that kosher?</p>
<p><strong>03:09</strong> Labour gaining lead again and the margin between them and Conservatives widens to 85 and 79 respectively.</p>
<p><strong>03:08</strong> Results for Edinburgh South West:</p>
<p>Alistair Darling re-elected !</p>
<p><strong>03:02</strong> Too much talk of &quot;change&quot; for my liking, ripping off Obama much?</p>
<p><strong>03:01</strong> Results update, with 178 seats announced:</p>
<p>Labour: 76
Conservatives: 73
Lib Dems: 9</p>
<p><strong>03:00</strong> Cameron makes snide comment at Labour government for allowing voting mishap to happen.</p>
<p><strong>02:59</strong> David Cameron takes Witney, and the Conservatives are closing in on the Labour party.</p>

<p><strong>02:40</strong> Another prediction of a hung parliament, judging by the exit polls!</p>
<p><strong>02:39</strong> Angry voters turned away from voting at Manchester earlier today ( where I am! ). Students who turned up without polling cards being blamed !</p>
<p><strong>02:38</strong> The seats are closing in between Conservatives and Labour:</p>
<p>Conservatives: 58
Labour: 43
Lib Dems: 6</p>

<p><strong>02:23</strong> Big victory for Conservatives in Montgomeryshire !</p>
<p><strong>02:20</strong> In response to personality over policies, well the Lib Dems dismal performance seem to suggest that policies still play a huge role in elections.</p>
<p><strong>02:18</strong> Hung parliament has been continuously predicted tonight !</p>
<p><strong>02:18</strong> Clegg effect &quot;not translating into seats&quot;, according to BBC.</p>
<p><strong>02:18</strong> Hundreds of voters were apparently turned away from voting earlier today.</p>

<p><strong>02:10</strong> Shout out for anyone still awake !!</p>

<p>Lib Dems 4</p>
<p><strong>02:06</strong> Thank you so much Zahra! It&#039;s Chiifen here now people, back from a night out in Manchester, so please, be patient with me !!</p>
<p><strong>02:05</strong> Righto! It&#039;s been fun and it&#039;s still too close to call. This is me signing off. Enjoy the mad suspense, people! - ZY</p>
<p><strong>02:04</strong> Results update:</p>
<p>Labour - 32 seats</p>
<p>Cons - 18 seats</p>
<p>Lib Dems - unchanged.</p>
<p><strong>02:02</strong> Two bad results for the Lib Dems who have failed to secure their top target seat of Guilford where the Tories have hung on comfortable and the City of Durham. Questions on whether anyone has seen where the Lib Dem surge has gone?</p>
<p>The Tories have won another seat.</p>
<p><strong>01:54</strong> 4.0% swing to Tories.</p>
<p>Labour - 28 seats</p>
<p>Tories - 14 seats.</p>
<p>Lib Dems - 4</p>
<p>Democratic Unionist Party - 4</p>
<p>Sinn Fein - 2</p>
<p>Social Democratic and Labour Party - 1
Plaid Cymru - 1</p>
<p>SNP - 1</p>
<p>Alliance Party - 1</p>
<p>57/650 seats declared.</p>
<p><strong>01:50</strong> SNP win first seat of night.</p>
<p><strong>01:48</strong> Labour - 26 seats.</p>
<p>Tories - 12 seats.</p>
<p>53/650 seats declared. Turnout has been huge. Well done, UK!</p>
<p><strong>01:46</strong> I&#039;m now back, alive with a can of red bull! My thanks to AirRaven.</p>
<p>The pundits&#039; sentence don&#039;t bode well for Brown. Robinson on Brown &#039;his eyes spoke of defeat&#039;. Dimbleby - &quot;[Brown] wrapping up his career as leader of the Labour Party&quot;. Blunkett: &#039;Labour can&#039;t win&#039;</p>
<p>Cheers emanating from both the Courtyard and the TV on the announcement of results for Labour. Sidiq Kahn wins Tooting.</p>
<p><strong>01:41</strong> Labour - 21 seats.</p>
<p><strong>01:34</strong> Latest from Alastair Campbell - still too early to make firm calls.</p>
<p>Brown retains his seat.</p>
<p><strong>01:12</strong> Latest figures. 37/650 seats declared.</p>
<p>Labour - 19 seats</p>
<p>Cons -  5 seats</p>
<p>Lib Dems - 4 seats</p>
<p>Plaid Cymru - 1</p>
<p>Other - 7 seats</p>
<p><strong>01:05</strong> First Conservative win in Kingswood with a swing of 9.4%. Seat gained from Labour. This is being viewed as an indication of what can happen later, should it be repeated over the country.</p>
<p><strong>01:02</strong> A mostly Labour crowd in the Courtyard o_o</p>
<p>According to the BBC, word is that Caroline Lucas has won Brighton Pavilion. This won&#039;t be verified until 2am.</p>
<p><strong>00:59</strong> First Lib Dem seat of the night. Thornby &amp; Yate.</p>
<p>Also Alliance have won a seat.</p>
<p><strong>00:54</strong> 2 more seats for Labour.</p>
<p>In Northern Ireland, a 22.9% swing, a &#039;mass defeat for Peter Robinson&#039;, leader of the DUP and Ireland&#039;s First Minister who has been defeated in Belfast East.</p>
<p><strong>00:49</strong> News from York! 100s of postal ballot have gone missing. The missing votes will be significant for the Lib Dems in York Outer and pave the way for a losing party to challenge tonight&#039;s result in the courts.</p>
<p><strong>00:39</strong> Sinn Fein - 1 seat. 23,000+</p>
<p>Democratic Unionist Party - 1 seat. 27,000+</p>
<p>More on this Polling fiasco. Liverpool City Council adamant they did nothing wrong, &quot;every elector who wanted to vote had the opportunity to do so before polls closed at 10pm&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>00:27</strong> Some damning and very relevant words from Nick Robinson&#039;s blog.</p>
<p>&quot;What a tragedy that, after a campaign which engaged and energised many who were previously cynical about politics, tonight&#039;s story may be being overshadowed by the extraordinary revelation that Britain cannot competently run the most basic part of the democratic process.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>00:25</strong> Facebook was taken down taken? O_o That&#039;s news to me.</p>
<p><strong>00:22</strong> Breaking news: Counting has ceased in Londonderry following a security alert. Army bomb disposal experts are on the scene.</p>
<p>Back to the Polling Shambles- in Chester 600 people have been turned away, according to Labour. This could prove disastrous for Labour who has a notional majority of just 973 in the city.</p>
<p><strong>00:16</strong> The Tories need 300 seats to conduct business without major obstruction, albeit with some ad hoc deals. If they get below, the Lib Dems and Labour would be in a stronger position to disagree and try for better.</p>
<p><strong>00:12</strong> Some hints being dropped by the likes of Harman and Lord Mandelson on a Lib-Lab coalition.</p>
<p><strong>00:10</strong> Where is that Red Bull? The Electoral Commission has issued a statement apologising to voters who were in possession of ballot papers, but were locked out. This comes in amid reports that the &#039;failed voters in Sheffield are blocking roads around polling stations to stop ballot boxes being removed&#039;.</p>
<p><strong>23:58</strong> David Miliband states that a &#039;massive amount of&#039; Ashcroft&#039;s money was poured into Sunderland Central and achieved little effect. There is more excitement to come. &quot;If no party ends up with a majority, then no party has a right to a monopoly of power.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>23:56</strong> &#039;Gideon&#039; Osborne thinks there is no question that Brown should resign. &quot;The Conservative party has gained more seats than at any time since 1931.&quot; There has been a swing to the Tories in all three seats so far. And all three Labour MPs who were victorious were all women. Some interesting tidbits for you there.</p>
<p><strong>23:52</strong> Nick Griffin receiving some boos from the Courtyard crowd. The BNP saved their deposit in Washington and Sunderland West. Robinson from the Beeb reading out the official apology to the Sheffield voters turned away. Apparently there were more problems in London and Merseyside, along with two lock-ins in Brum. Awful stuff.</p>
<p><strong>23:44</strong> Sunderland Central result up now. Another Labour win. 4.8 swing to Tories.</p>
<p>Labour 19000+</p>
<p>Cons 12000+</p>
<p><strong>23:40</strong> Courtyard is packed. I&#039;m genuinely surprised - who said student interest in politics was dead? Gideon on the screen. Cannot hear a word. Looking smug though.</p>
<p><strong>23:36</strong> Clegg&#039;s gone to personally apologise to people in his constituency of Sheffield who were turned away. Oh dear.</p>
<p><strong>23:32</strong> Labour win Washington and Sunderland West. 11.6 swing to Tories in a safe Labour seat.</p>
<p><strong>23:19</strong> More disconcerting talk of people having been turned away from polling stations and having been unable to vote despite turning up on time. This is also a whispering about a Tory electoral onslaught  if the swing of 8.4% in Houghton and Sunderland South is repeated across the country. Crikey! I hope you&#039;re as excited as I am.</p>
<p><strong>23:15</strong> (Cheers for reading, folks!T&#039;was getting rather lonesome.) The BBC has revised the exit poll figures. New figures follow:</p>
<p>Conservatives: 305
Labour: 255
Lib Dems: 61
Others: 29</p>
<p><strong>23:07</strong> Just in from FiveThirtyEight.com (American polling website). Think David Cameron is on course for a majority.</p>
<p><strong>23:01</strong> A bit of news on Northern Ireland: Conservatives may not have enough to produce an outright majority but their partnership with the UUP could be beneficial, however this depends on them gaining seats. It is predicted that the most they will get is 4, will they turn to the DUP for help, who are predicted 9 seats.</p>
<p><strong>22:56</strong> Results from Sunderland now. Labour win.
Labour        19,137	50.3	-11.7</p>
<p>Conservative  8,147	21.4	+5.2</p>
<p>BNP           1,961	5.2	-1.7</p>
<p>Lib Dems      5,292	13.9	-0.6</p>
<p><strong>22:51</strong> News just in. Mr Schwarzenegger congratulated Cameron on his victory. &#039;&quot;Just called @davidcameron to congratulate him &#039;on the victory. Even though results aren&#039;t in we know the Conservatives had a great day.&quot;&#039;</p>
<p><strong>22:45</strong> Police have been summoned to move people from polling stations in Sheffield. People who&#039;ve spent hours waiting to queue to no avail. Sunderland&#039;s result expected any minute now.</p>
<p><strong>22:15</strong> Courtyard is finally getting lively! About time. Harman and Johnson still remain optimistic on Labour&#039;s chances, while the pundits discuss the likely outcome of a hung parliament. Vince Cable, on the other hand, finds the exit poll result &#039;very strange&#039; and questions its accuracy. It was &#039;horribly wrong&#039; in the past.</p>
<p><strong>22:09</strong> A Tory minority government, anyone? - Sunderland&#039;s results just getting in. Not long left now.</p>
<p><strong>22:05</strong> The exit poll predicts a hung parliament with the Conservatives as the largest party. &quot;The poll puts the Conservatives on 307 seats, Labour on 255, the Liberal Democrats on 59 and others on 29,&quot; according to the BBC&#039;s website.</p>
<p><strong>21:51</strong> So - We&#039;re expecting Sunderland&#039;s results to be released first. In other news, Brown has apparently had a nap in anticipation to tonight&#039;s ordeal while Cameron killed time chopping logs. No mention of Clegg - suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>21:33</strong> The Beeb have just announced that the result of the first ever joint exit poll conducted by the BBC, Sky and ITV will be revealed at 10pm. Intriguing.</p>
<p><strong>21:14</strong> Less than an hour to go before the polling stations close. Have you voted?</p>
<p><strong>21:10</strong> Watching Channel 4&#039;s coverage at the Courtyard. This has become a comedy affair - Jimmy Carr, David Mitchell and co. Has the Election really become such a drab affair to require help from the funny men (and possibly women)?</p>
<p><strong>21:07</strong> Evening, folks! Would just like to reiterate that this is the Election Results blog. So, welcome and stick around for what should be a fascinating evening!</p>
<p><strong>20:49</strong> Sorry guys I know it says Roses but this IS the elections results liveblog, so stay tuned for live updates !</p>

			<p>I agree with you, James. That Polling fiasco shouldn&#039;t have happened. Appalling.</p>
<p>And the drama continues to unfold. I&#039;m just surprised that initial exit poll was fairly accurate.</p>
<p>Cheers, ChiiFen! Kudos to you on your superb efforts, particularly after a night out =D</p>
