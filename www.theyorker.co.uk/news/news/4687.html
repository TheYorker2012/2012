					<div style="float:right;margin-top:0;line-height:95%;width:180px;">

				<div class="Date">Tuesday, 4th May 2010</div>
		<div class="Author">

		</div>
		<div class="SubText">Julian Sturdy was born and bred in Yorkshire and currently lives in the York village of Tockwith with his wife Victoria and two children, George and Florence. He was selected as the Conservative candidate for the York Outer seat in 2006 and has been tirelessly campaigning since then. On Monday he visited the University of York to meet and talk to students at Vanbrugh. Today he spoke with the Yorker, giving in-depth views on certain issues. </div>

        
<ul><li><strong>How did your visit on Monday at the university go?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Julian Sturdy</strong>: It was great! I set up a stall with Conservative supporters at the university and I talked to students.  It went really well.</p>

<ul><li><strong>As a student in York and as someone who will be going into the job market in the near future, how will the Conservatives serve me?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: Well, in terms of jobs, economy is key. We need to get the economy growing and the next two years are crucial to get it in a forward direction to create a culture for jobs. We do not believe in the national insurance contribution rise from the Labour party. This will stop small businesses from growing and will ultimately create job losses. This has to be stopped. We also plan to support new businesses and entrepreneurs. Any new businesses in the next two years will not have to pay national insurance contribution for their first ten employees. That&rsquo;s a key policy. We need to cut back on bureaucracy and the burden on small businesses the government currently has on them to allow them to trade economically. Regarding education, we definitely need quality at our universities. York is a fantastic university; top ten in the UK and top 100 in the world. We need to get this quality across the country so that our students are highly recognised and qualified. We don&rsquo;t feel we can cut tuition fees, but we do plan on investing in more university places. We need to accommodate those who have been working but are reapplying for retraining as well. We do not believe in having a target 50% of students at university. We believe university should be accessible to all, but we want to focus on honing alternative, vocational skills as well.</p>

<ul><li><strong>The BBC has calculated that the Lib Dems have a 0.4% advantage over the Conservatives in York outer. What are you feelings about that? How confident are you about your chances of winning?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: Well, the response we have been receiving at doorsteps have been really good. As far as we can tell, support for us is growing. There is a general feeling that it is time for change and only the Conservatives can bring change.  We can change the current Labour government to lead the country forward to a better and brighter future.  The Lib Dems will not be able to do that.</p>

<ul><li><strong>York Outer is a new constituency. Has that affected your campaign?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: No it hasn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s exciting. It&rsquo;s good that York now has two parliamentary seats. It is a lot better for York in terms of getting things done. If I&rsquo;m fortunate enough to be elected, I&rsquo;m Yorkshire born and bred, so I will be able to focus on relevant issues. However, if not, in terms of issues such as infrastructure and healthcare services, we all need to put aside our differences and work together for the greater good of York.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Why did you get involved in politics? What would your advice be to students interested in following such a career path?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: I don&rsquo;t come from a political background. I studied agriculture at university and am a farmer by trade. I just found myself increasingly frustrated about the government. My father then told me to get off my backside and do something about it. So I did. I got involved with the Conservative party, campaigning and basically working my way through this. I am very patriotic and what drives me the most is that I want a country that my children can grow up in. If you&rsquo;re frustrated about something, then get involved. It is a great way to give back to the society and you can really make a difference.</p>
