        <p><strong>22:52</strong> And, thank god, that&#039;s it.</p>
<p><strong>22:52</strong> Ngwena would be in Gryffindor (sigh why won&#039;t anyone pick Slytherin?) He&#039;d back Hutchings and chooses Nouse. 4-1 Nouse an absolute rout.</p>
<p><strong>22:50</strong> Powell hopes he&#039;d be in Gryffindor because he fancies Hermione despite her being young...</p>
<p>He would back Dave (Hansen) then David (Levene). And he picks Vision so 3-1.</p>
<p><strong>22:49</strong> Hutchings cleverly points out that since he&#039;s a muggle he can&#039;t be in a house. He hesitantly chooses Ravenclaw, because facebook told him so. Hansen if anyone else, and failing that Levene.</p>
<p>And now 3-0 Nouse due to the influence of Henry James Foy and to his &quot;many fingers&quot;</p>
<p><strong>22:46</strong> Freckelton would be Gryffindor and thinks Ngwena is great. Really great.</p>
<p>And 2 - 0 Nouse.</p>
<p><strong>22:45</strong> Levene would be in Ravenclaw if he were in Harry Potter, and would vote Hutchings if he was going to vote for anyone else.</p>
<p>And in the return of the Nouse vs Vision debate, he chooses Nouse.</p>
<p><strong>22:42</strong> Levene thinks that we need to have light sensors in order to cut energy waste. Levene denounces Satan in the guise of Peter Mandelson. He&#039;s bitter apparently since Mandy mocked his hair.</p>
<p><strong>22:40</strong> Ngwena wants to encourage university staff to recycle more, and denounces Satan but only because there isn&#039;t an iPhone app to give him a better answer.</p>
<p><strong>22:39</strong> Powell wants to encourage more recycling and tactfully denounces Satan.</p>
<p>It was Hansen up next but he just walked off. For those of you at home, it is worth mentioning that he looked like a cross between a human Dr Who villian and a porn baron.</p>
<p><strong>22:37</strong> Hutchings wants more recycling on campus, and agrees with Freckelton on energy saving lightbulbs Possible policy theft as well as he suggests he wants to bring in water coolers (props to Chris Etheridge?). He also considers Satan has loveable qualities.</p>
<p>Roberto</p>
<p><strong>22:33</strong> Freckelton wants to improve campus lighting and denounces Satan and &quot;all his evil little acts&quot;</p>
<p><strong>22:31</strong> Freckelton will move censorship out of the hands of sabs and into an independent body.  This man was born for public speaking. He even has the hand movements down.</p>
<p><strong>22:29</strong> Levene thinks that Ngwena has done a great job, but believes that Ngwena has been strongest at communication whilst Levene imagines himself as more of a campaigning president.</p>
<p><strong>22:28</strong> Ngwena believes he hit the ground running, and subtly points out that he knows what the president has to do already.</p>
<p><strong>22:27</strong> Powell promises to improve the career service.</p>
<p>Hansen finds the question about what he&#039;d do about careers service too offensive and intrusive to answer.</p>
<p><strong>22:25</strong> Hutchings is talking about the careers service, but Niall thinks it more prudent to point out that Jason Rose got 788 in his Sats (see earlier). Thanks comment #6 person.</p>
<p><strong>22:22</strong> Hutchings says he will do a lot of different things to the current president but then says that the current pres hasn&#039;t had the same problems that Hutchings will. He dismisses the question as silly.</p>
<p><strong>22:20</strong> Hutchings thinks we need to get porters. In the swimming pool. With margaritas. Porters are important, and he praises Tim and Ben&#039;s work on it. He chooses YSTV. YSTV WIN 4-2!</p>
<p><strong>22:18</strong> Freckleton says the pool is coming but a long term thing, so at the minute porters are the priority, same as what Tim said really. But he does pick YSTV, so they move back into the lead against URY.</p>
<p><strong>22:16</strong> Levene thinks a swimming pool has been a long time coming and is important to attract new students. He backs YSTV, but only out of fear of Anna Bucks, YUM chair and YSTV member. 2-2, game on.</p>
<p><strong>22:15</strong> Ngwena believes that porters is a short term goal that is achievable and that a swimming poolis a long term one.</p>
<p>Oh and URY making the score URY 2 - 1 YSTV</p>
<p><strong>22:13</strong> Powell wants to have more YUSU drop ins, incorporating the unions sponsor dominos. He makes the bold comment that 24 hour portering is never going to happen and we should focus on a swimming pool. YSTV versus URY? URY</p>
<p> Hansen is up now, he backs porters over pool. And YSTV over URY despite the fact that YSTV is &quot;a group of highly trained killers&quot;</p>
<p><strong>22:08</strong> Roberto Powell says he is the candidate who will be strong enough to take charge of elections to ensure smooth transition. He wants to train each JCRC individually on how to run events.</p>
<p>His notable achievement does not include fitting into skin-tight jeans, sadly. He seems to get emotional as he speaks about his role as Halifax chair as his biggest achievement.</p>
<p><strong>22:06</strong> Ollie Hutchings is glad the speeches are over as he was trying to read his speech upside down.</p>
<p>He talked very passionately about posters for a minute. He thinks a JCRC officer in YUSU is a good idea to centralise things a bit more.</p>
<p>His most notable achievement? Fitting in to his jeans tonight (they are pink, and very tight)</p>
<p><strong>22:04</strong> Freckelton&#039;s biggest achievement is winning the Best Enterprise Society.  And Ngwena&#039;s was sending an email to Brian Cantor ending with &quot;keep it cool&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>22:02</strong> David Levene is up now, but everything just seems grey after Hansen. Freckelton continues in the vein of David Cameron and Tony Blair. He should be running for Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>21:59</strong> As part of his policies, David Hansen would not allow joke candidates in elections. He even has the returning pro officer trying not to laugh. Hansen claims his biggest achievement to be the captain of the University first team. EVERY first team. He is follwed by Ngwena, who is saying a lot of sensible stuff but it drags after &quot;the other Dave&quot;</p>
<p><strong>21:57</strong> David Hansen approaches the stage to wolf-whistles. He is Dave from our nightmares, apparently.</p>
<p>He is telling us a thrilling tale about being raised as wolves. As part of his achievements... oh god, this guy is showing Saul and Pickard how a joke candidate should do it. There would have been more, but this guy is too brilliant</p>
<p><strong>21:53</strong> Roberto Powell is outlining his achievements as Halifax chair, claiming it will contribute to his competence as YUSU President. He will fight to keep campus bars open, and will get a cashpoint in Hes East. Basically, he wants us to elect him.</p>
<p><strong>21:52</strong> Ollie Hutchings begins with informing us that this is not a beauty contest or a fashion parade. Hm what gave it away?</p>
<p>He tells us to go and read his policies online because they are brilliant.</p>
<p>He tries a cheeky sentence after the returning officer calls time. She&#039;s having none of it.</p>
<p><strong>21:49</strong> Matthew Freckelton urges students to vote for the candidate who will get the job done and who will never cease fighting your corner. He regards his lack of experience in YUSU as an advantage, as he is free from pre-existing allegiances, and in true Obama-style is a candidate for real change. However he comes across as more Cameron.</p>
<p><strong>21:47</strong> David Levene has epic hair and a wealth of campaigning experience, or so he says. He plans to attend at least one JCRC meeting a year, to listen, not dictate. He also plans to work closely with Nouse and Vision (What about <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span>?)</p>
<p><strong>21:44</strong> Tim volunteers to go first and is delivering his speech. He says he wants to represent not only undergraduates, but right through to Post-grads and distance learners as well.</p>
<p>He draws on his experience on his previous year as YUSU President. Oh dear, how will the rest beat that?</p>
<p><strong>21:42</strong> Niall would like it to be known that he&#039;s voting Ben Humphrys because he just got a nice hug off him.</p>
<p><strong>21:41</strong> And we&#039;re starting again, with the last leg of Hustings: President !!</p>
<p><strong>21:37</strong> Matthew Freckelton with us right now, he says he is looking forward to giving his speech, hopes his voice won&#039;t go as he has been talking to students all day!</p>
<p>Ps. check out election videos on facebook group!</p>
<p><strong>21:35</strong> Bo seemed to be saying &quot;Ah well&quot; a lot in her speeches, which sums up her performance tonight quite succinctly.</p>
<p>Ah well, break time!</p>
<p><strong>21:33</strong> Laura Bo wants there to be a service to help students back to their dorm. She believes that the welfare officer should be a colleague not a co-ordinator WRT liberation campaigns. She doesn&#039;t know who to choose between Sugarbabes or Girls Aloud. Our returning officer gives her no choice. Girls Aloud then.</p>
<p>Given the choice between more welfare questions and a break, the audience chooses a break.</p>
<p><strong>21:30</strong> Warner-Medley doesn&#039;t like carnage, does work with council and police over students in town. Not welfare officers job to guide liberation campaigns. He said a lot more, but Niall is back at the wheel, and is a pathetically slow typer. Sorry folks</p>
<p>Oh and he&#039;s a Girls Aloud man.</p>
<p><strong>21:27</strong> Peter says we can criticise their campaign, but not on a personal level.  So calling their campaign &quot;Disgusting, grotesque, demeaning and despicable&quot; would be okay, but calling the people running &quot;disgusting, grotesque, demeaning and despicable&quot; would not. Hypothetically.</p>
<p>He would be a Guinea Pig.</p>
<p><strong>21:24</strong> Laura would like to be a bear. She has ears and everything. Wait, she doesn&#039;t want to be an actual bear in the forest, but the warm and fuzzy ones with pink ears.</p>
<p><strong>21:23</strong> Laura says hypothetically, let them run. She seems to be at a loss for words again. She doesn&#039;t really offer a proper answer.</p>
<p><strong>21:21</strong> Interesting Question: Hypothetically, what measures would you take against people who have triviliased the role Women&#039;s Officers? Hypothetically.</p>
<p><strong>21:20</strong> Laura is back on. Ah, normal talking speed, we&#039;ve missed you.</p>
<p>She wants to increase awareness on guidance in university through speaking to students. However, she doesn&#039;t seem to have much to say tonight.</p>
<p>in her words: &quot; On Porno,...&quot;</p>
<p>Laura understands that publicity is need for events like that, but is fully aware of the welfare issue of these events. She says the event itself is not the issue, it is the underlying causes that needs to be paid attention to.</p>
<p>She will put in 110% to her role, but does not answer her last question.</p>
<p><strong>21:17</strong> Peter says the Open Door should be publicised more.</p>
<p>LIGHTS OFF</p>
<p>LIGHTS BACK ON</p>
<p>Anyways, on what Warner-Medley is saying, we&#039;re lost. We&#039;re trying to keep up, but that man could commentate horse racing.</p>
<p><strong>21:13</strong> Peter says that students should not think it is the end of the world to seek counseling. He has just turned his board around. Not a bad board <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span> thinks.</p>
<p><strong>21:12</strong> Peter is back! At more comprehensible speed thankfully. He says papers should not get too personal but that it might be nice to see more features instead of insulting comments.</p>
<p>Momentarily blackout! Oops. Lights back on.</p>
<p><strong>21:10</strong> Bo wants to make sure students use facilities such as Nightline, through STYC training to inform freshers on where to get help.</p>
<p><strong>21:08</strong> Bo is at a loss for words! Not a good start for her I&#039;m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>21:06</strong> Her policies are: a STYC training session, a financial awareness stall at Freshers to help students plan their budgets all-year round. She wants to increase counseling... and time.</p>
<p><strong>21:05</strong> <strong>Laura Bo</strong>&#039; starts with a &quot; I wish I had started first now.&quot; Poor Laura.</p>
<p><strong>21:04</strong> He gets enthusiastic response from the audience, however, as he does a little dance at the end of his speech.</p>
<p><strong>21:02</strong> Welfare officers candidates! Laura Bo and Peter Warner-Medley. Andrew is MIA</p>
<p>Peter goes first. At insane speed. <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> is hearing, &quot; YUSU, battles, ISA, familiar with, communications...&quot; What?</p>
<p><strong>21:00</strong> Andrew McIlwraith isn&#039;t here. There were hockey elections tonight so I wonder if that&#039;s taken priority.</p>
<p><strong>20:59</strong> <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> would like to apologise for their previous statement. Vision and Nouse are not crap.</p>
<p><strong>20:57</strong> Bailey was moved up a year in primary school.</p>
<p>On the Nouse/Vision question Bailey gives <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span> a shout out. He gets our vote! He does however vote vision and so, as our returning officer points out, we are now in deadlock, true x-factor style.</p>
<p>Nouse 2-2  Vision</p>
<p>Nouse wins audience&#039;s votes.</p>
<p><strong>20:53</strong> Vince has no idea what her Year 2 sats results are, Year 9 was an impressive 778.</p>
<p>Nouse has misquoted her and Vision has misspelt her name, but Nouse, but only if a gun was held to her head. Hm.</p>
<p>Nouse 2-1 Vision</p>
<p><strong>20:51</strong> <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> would like to think we&#039;re above this silly little competition!</p>
<p><strong>20:49</strong> Rose picks Nouse.</p>
<p>Nouse 1-1 Vision</p>
<p><strong>20:49</strong> Update: Humphrys chooses Vision over Nouse! Scandalous in a room full of Nouse reporters. I wonder if this has made it up to Nouse&#039;s website.</p>
<p><strong>20:47</strong> Breaking! Ben Humphrys got 887 in Year 9 sats</p>
<p>Also reveals that YUSU will get departmental budgets in future.</p>
<p><strong>20:43</strong> What will the candidates do next year if they don&#039;t get this position?</p>
<p>Rose: Here, study.
Humphrys has applied for an MSc here.
Bailey: PGC in teaching and science.
Vince: I will be looking into animal rights work and set up her own small business. She reiterates that this is not for her CV.</p>
<p>Is this really what the candidates want to do for the next year?
Rose: Yes. (very bold)
Humphrys: I&#039;ve thought long and hard about this. I am a very academically orientated, and there is really so much we can do, so I hope you will vote me in to do it. (<span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> thinks that he means &quot;yes&quot;, what say you?)
Bailey: Most definitely.
Vince: Hell yes!</p>
<p>In other news, the debate over who is doing the live blog for <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span> has been won by Chiifen after it was realised Niall was crap.</p>
<p>Chiifen: Awww</p>
<p><strong>20:37</strong> After that excitement I&#039;ve entirely lost track of what Ben Humprhys is saying. He sounds informed if that helps.</p>
<p><strong>20:36</strong> DRAMA - THE NOUSE BANNER HAS FALLEN OFF THE WALL</p>
<p><strong>20:33</strong> Vince in the spotlight. She makes no promise about not making us listen to Mika ever again.</p>
<p>Rose up. An introduction stating his many previous positions as per usual. He will try to cut the fees of students studying abroad and offer more support. Rose won&#039;t promise anything, but says he wouldn&#039;t have used Mika if he had his way.</p>
<p>Humphrys says he would integrate international students by working closely with the ISA, offering cultural and language support for example. He stressed the importance for departments to deal with problems themselves, but if not, he will step in.</p>
<p>Humphrys also declares his love for Mika, but is willing to change his mind for YSTV.</p>
<p>Lastly, Bailey! He wants to push towards international course reps. He says departments are responsible for their poor teaching standards. He draws a lot of his points from the Chemistry department, commending their feedback system.</p>
<p>Finally, Bailey is NOT a fan of Mika.</p>
<p><strong>20:24</strong> The Pro Returning Officer has just declared her love for Mika. Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>20:23</strong> Ben Humphrys up now. He says the printing problem is something that will be easily changed. Humphrys will try to change the structural problems with VLE. He stresses the need for more feedback for each module.</p>
<p><strong>20:22</strong> Jason Rose declares that he refuses to pay his -1.40 on his printer credit. The audience has to be reminded to applause. Applause ensues.</p>
<p><strong>20:20</strong> Vince is seems to be struggling on the web content question, but is gaining her momentum back as she heatedly suggests a user-friendly system for tutor-advise, printing etc.</p>
<p><strong>20:15</strong> Rose argues he has the most experience in academic affairs, having sat on university committees as well as YUSU</p>
<p><strong>20:14</strong> Humprhys outlines his YUSU experience as well as promising to fight for HE funding. Bailey promises much of the same, promising to fight for students now rather than a Hes East priority in the uni. Vince tells us she is running because she cares about this, saying its for students, not her CV.</p>
<p><strong>20:08</strong> Humprys begins. A dramatic speech to say the least, beginning with &quot;as an institution we face great danger&quot;. Oh my.</p>
<p><strong>20:02</strong> 3 more positions, up next is Academic, then Welfare and finally President! Starting now!</p>
<p><strong>20:00</strong> Matt Bailey, running for Academic Affairs Officer admits that he&#039;s an outsider, but has really good qualities nevertheless and thinks that it will be a close one.</p>
<p><strong>19:59</strong> 5 minutes till we start again people! Get yourself on glued to this page!</p>
<p><strong>19:55</strong> The consensus in the room seems to be that Pickard and Saul&#039;s stunt has backfired on them, instead of making the women&#039;s committee look pointless, they&#039;ve shown how important they are.</p>
<p><strong>19:53</strong> Janey Stephenson on Saul and Pickard &quot;I bet their mothers are really proud of them&quot;</p>
<p><strong>19:48</strong> Break time!</p>
<p><strong>19:48</strong> They finish their speech right on time. They also plan on making campaigns more dynamic and exciting by using the college network. They plan to keep focusing on the portering campaign as they feel it is a relevant issue.</p>
<p>Given the choice of eating a live badger and having Jack Russell Terriers for feet, they would choose doggy feet to help them get around campus faster.</p>
<p><strong>19:44</strong> Luke David Sandford &amp; Suzy Dodd are running unopposed for Campaigns Officers. After this a break, we are told!</p>
<p><strong>19:44</strong> Mandi and Winnie are keen to have &quot;White&quot; participation in the Racial Equality committee. On the topic of scholarship for BME students to study at York, they respond by saying that it was a &quot;tricky issue&quot;. First week next term, they plan to have a welcome party to let more students know about what they&#039;re doing. With that, they close and make way for Campaigns Ofiicers candidates.</p>
<p><strong>19:38</strong> Tom Martin &amp; Nell Beecham opened with a tagline of &quot;LGBT: Less what you do, more who you are.&quot; They are looking to try to include all members of the LGBT community.</p>
<p>Helen Houghton &amp; Philip Morris suggested a day for boys to be referred to her and girls to be referred as him to promote awareness.  They are looking to make people feel proud of their LGBT identity.</p>
<p>Big exodus after they leave as members of York&#039;s LGBT community leave. Racial Equality now with Mandi Modavo &amp; Winnie Amoaku running unopposed</p>
<p><strong>19:23</strong> And the hustings for Women&#039;s Officer come to an end with the pair of boys being called &#039;twats&#039; as a grand finale, up next, LGBT !</p>
<p><strong>19:21</strong> Some outrageous policies have been suggested by Pickard and Saul, such as banning fat women, and portraying attractive women on campus media at all time. The pair is receiving a lot of backlash from the audience. As they claim men are &quot;annoyed&quot; at the role of Women&#039;s Officers, the men in the audience have responded with &quot;I&#039;m not annoyed&quot; followed by a loud round of applause from everyone.</p>
<p><strong>19:17</strong> A heckle of &quot;death to you&quot; gets more laughs than Pickard and Saul&#039;s chant of &quot;death to men&quot;. Stephenson and Philips hope to sort out problems such as &#039;rape alley&#039;. The hall is definitely on their side as the boys comedy pitch has gone down like a ton of bricks.</p>
<p><strong>19:15</strong> Among Pickard and Saul&#039;s policies: Male-only parking spaces so that women will be discouraged to drive.</p>
<p><strong>19:14</strong> Stephenson and Philips want to raise awareness of issues such as the pay gap and sexuality. Pickard and Saul, on the other hand, will ban male candidates for Women&#039;s Officer next year and end their speech with &quot;Death to Men&quot;!</p>
<p><strong>19:10</strong> Mark Pickard and Peter Saul go first. Their attempt at comedy falls flat as they justify their campaign on &#039;the basis that they like women&#039; before mocking feminist stereotypes. Stephenson and Philips get a huge cheer after their pitch.</p>
<p><strong>19:07</strong> And here we go...
</p>
<div style="float: left; width: 180px; padding: 2px"><a href="../../photos/full/4587.jpg"><img src="../../photos/userimage/4587.jpg" height="64" width="53" title="User Image not found" alt="User Image not found"  /></a><div></div></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>19:00</strong> <strong>Ollie Hutchings</strong>, on his way to purchase his customary can of Relentless told <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span>, &quot;It&#039;s a wide open field, a lot of the policies for the Presidency are actually rather homogenous.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>18:57</strong> When asked about how they feel about running against men for the Women&#039;s Officer,<strong> Janey Stephenson</strong> and <strong>Charlotte Philips</strong> said, &quot;We respect their right to self define one&#039;s gender, but this should not be abused. Some of our trans friends have felt offended by this.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>18:52</strong> The candidates have just come back from their briefing! Should be starting soon!</p>
<p><strong>18:50</strong> &#039;<strong>Captain&#039; Nick Scarlett</strong> reckons portering will be big AND THE RETURNING OFFICER IS IN THE BUILDING!</p>
<p><strong>18:46</strong> The order for tonight&#039;s hustings will be:</p>
<p>1. Women&#039;s Officer
2. LGBT
3. Racial Equality
4. Disability
5. Campaigns Officer
6. Academic
7. Welfare
8. President</p>
<p><strong>18:44</strong> Five minutes have passed, and we are now told we&#039;ll have to wait 15 minutes for the returning officer, is it me, or did time move backwards?</p>
<p><strong>18:39</strong> With no Lewis Bretts we have an alternative returning officer tonight. Who it is remains a mystery for the moment, but we do know that we&#039;ll be waiting for another 10 minutes or so as we wait for her to arrive from Manchester.</p>
<p><strong>18:35</strong> The sabbs have written &#039;YUSU HUSTINGS!&#039; on the board - in the meantime, Tim is handing out his leaflets.</p>
<p><strong>18:28</strong> PX001 is now filling up with anticipation as we get ready for round 1 of hustings!</p>
