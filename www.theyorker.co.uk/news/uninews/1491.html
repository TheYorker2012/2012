		<div class="SubText">Last night, Edge hosted the second night of Hustings.
</div>

        <p>The remaining positions of Ents, Student Action Chair, RAG President, Training, Environment and Ethics, Student Development and Charities, Societies and Communications and AU President were all debated.</p>
<p>The format was the same as the night before, with candidates making a three minute speech and then taking questions from the audience.</p>
<p>First up were the uncontested Ents candidates Naomi Dodds and Ed Durkin. They stated that they would &ldquo;immerse ourselves completely in this position&rdquo;, the candidates went on to list policies such as greater variety of events, a DJ list with a range of DJs to promote diversity, later license and further integration of campus societies.</p>
<p>Next was Student Action Chair candidate Adam Wiles who mentioned his previous experiences as SAC treasurer and said he was &ldquo;incredibly enthusiastic and dedicated&rdquo; to the role. His policies included raising the profile of Student Action by improving Student Action week and creating a mega college challenge with reward points, in the hope of it acting as an incentive towards volunteering.</p>
<p>Training Candidate Collette Kerrigan, speaking on behalf of her fellow running-mate Rhianna Kinchin, spoke of the importance of making training as relevant as possible and offering societies training as well.</p>
<p>In the first contested position of the night, RAG President hopefuls Alexander Fink and Helen Adam both spoke of their relevant experience which they believe make them the best people for the job.</p>
<p>Fink emphasised his role as Alcuin RAG rep and said he wanted to increase participation by having elections to allow students to decide which charities to support.</p>
<p>Adams also mentioned her position as Goodricke RAG rep and said she hopes to increase communication between different charitable societies and increase participation by taking RAG raid to other cities.</p>
<p>Environment and Ethics saw three sets of candidates take the stage: John Nicholls and Joe Thwaites; Lena Jeha and Tom Barnes &amp; Ed Morrison.</p>
<p>Nicholls and Thwaites said they would &ldquo;work hard to represent student concerns&rdquo; and stressed the need for an environmentally sustainable Hes East, as well campaigning for ethical investment and banking.</p>
<p>Jeha said she is &ldquo;passionate for the environment&rdquo; and wants to create workshops where students can learn how to save electricity and waste.</p>
<p>Barnes and Morrison said they &ldquo;believe this is an area that is incredibly important&rdquo; and highlighted student apathy as the biggest problem which they plan to combat with a revamped website and an awareness scheme.</p>
<p>When asked about the toxic lake, Barnes and Morrison said it was &ldquo;disgusting&rdquo; and that they would need to lobby the university. Jeha said steps are being taken to prevent the same thing happening in Hes East but doesn&rsquo;t know if the university would be willing to spend the money to change the situation in Hes West. Nicholls and Thwaites said they&rsquo;d spoken to Vice-Chancellor Brian Cantor and are looking into having more wildlife around the lake to absorb the waste.</p>
<p>Jamie Tyler, Sarah Witts and Fran Olley were the three candidates competing for Student Development and Charities.</p>
<p>Tyler spoke of the need to improve communication and raise the profile of RAG and Student Action and instituting online sign up for all volunteering projects. He said he has the &ldquo;relevant experience and realistic policies&rdquo; needed.</p>
<p>Witts said she is &ldquo;hugely passionate about student volunteering and charity&rdquo; and wants better publicity and stressed the need for better inclusion.</p>
<p>Olley said her aim was &ldquo;for every student to leave university with an enriching experience&rdquo;. She wants to help support Student Action projects and increase communication between the different campus projects.</p>
<p>Societies and Communications candidates Matt Harris, Chaz Taylor and Rory Shanks took to the stage next.</p>
<p>Harris said &ldquo;what we get just isn&rsquo;t good enough&rdquo; and highlighted the need for more funding, space, equipment and training, promising that he &ldquo;will fight for your rights as students in York&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Taylor spoke of his past participation in societies saying &ldquo;I have had the time of my life in York and it&rsquo;s all due to societies&rdquo;. He mentioned problems such as booking rooms, transportation and storage and said he wants to get in touch with every society at least once a term.</p>
<p>Shanks claimed he &ldquo;knows how to get things done&rdquo; and spoke of the importance of relevant training for societies, of having more facilities in Hes East and of securing campus media.</p>
<p>Finally the AU candidates took the stage to much cheering and applause from the audience. Alex Lacey, Jack Kennedy, Chris Collinson and Max Coney and Aimee Gamble are all running, however Gamble could not make the event.</p>
<p>All candidates made known their different experiences in sports. Lacey as Boxing Club president and instructor, Kennedy as AU vice-president, Chris Collinson as former Yorker sports editor and Max Coney as Canoe Club captain.</p>
<p>Lacey focused on the need to give the AU more direction and focus and on promoting an inclusive approach to sports.</p>
<p>Kennedy spoke of Hes East as a new opportunity to correct facility mistakes and of the need to improve the athletics track.</p>
<p>Collinson mentioned the need to build on the &lsquo;sport at York&rsquo; UGM motion and also to improve the athletics track as well as insulating the tent.</p>
<p>Coney said he &ldquo;knows the pressures a lot of club presidents are facing&rdquo; and want to help the clubs&rsquo; money go further.</p>
<p><em>Voting on all positions opens on Monday.</em></p>
