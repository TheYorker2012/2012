		</div>
		<div class="SubText">Nominations for this year&rsquo;s YUSU elections closed yesterday. Campaigning begins on Tuesday, with Hustings taking place on Tuesday and Wednesday evening.</div>

        
<ul><li><strong>Sabbatical Officers</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>This year sees four candidates running for YUSU <strong>President</strong>. As expected, Charles Bushby, a third-year management student of Alcuin College, Tom Langrish, one of the current YUSU Policy and Campaigns Officers and the Chair of YUSU Council, and Tim Ngwena, a third-year management student who is currently the Chair of Fusion, have all put their names forward.</p>
<p>More surprising was the inclusion of Grant Bradley, a second-year management student from Derwent College.</p>
<p>There are also four candidates running for <strong>Democracy and Services</strong>, the position that will replace Services and Finance next year. One of the current YUSU Ents Officers, Ed Durkin, is running, as is former Derwent Ents Rep and YUSU Ents Assistant Lewis Bretts.</p>
<p>David Sharp, former Halifax President, and George Papadofragakis, ISA Welfare Officer and the current Chair of the Democratic Socialists&#039; Association, are also in the running.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s election for <strong>Sports President</strong> is the most contested officer position, with five candidates nominated. York Sport Tournament Secretary Gemma Johnson, who studies management, and York Sport Treasurer and physics student Michael Leahy have both entered the race.</p>
<p>The other three candidates are Kath Mildon, a postgraduate student studying Health Sciences, Emily Scott, the third-year PPE student who presents YSTV&rsquo;s York Sport Show, and Michael Sneddon, an economics student and former Sports Editor for <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> who is currently writing for <em>Vision</em>.</p>
<p>YUSU Societies and Communications Officer Rory Shanks will be running for <strong>Student Activities</strong>, a position created to replace the one he currently holds.</p>
<p>Shanks will be competing against Rhianna Kinchin, a history student and current YUSU Training Officer, and Ella-Grace Kirton, a third-year English student who is currently the Press and Publicity Officer for the York Labour Club.</p>
<p>The Academic and Welfare Officer is being split into two positions &ndash; <strong>Academic Affairs Officer</strong> and <strong>Welfare Officer</strong>. Charlie Leyland, the current YUSU Academic and Welfare Officer, will be running for Academic Affairs.</p>
<p>Three candidates are competing for the Welfare position; they are Ben Humphrys, third-year philosophy and economics student and current YUSU LGBT Officer, Matthew Pallas, third-year philosophy and politics student and former YUSU LGBT Officer, and Jennifer Coyle, third-year management student and Vanbrugh JCRC Ordinary Member.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Part Time Officers</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>Of the part-time positions, only the LGBT and RAG Officer positions see more than one candidate entered.</p>
<p>There are two pairs of candidates running for <strong>LGBT Officer</strong>. Two first-year students, Mandi Madavo, and James Ball, both of Derwent College and studying history of art and music respectively, will be competing against two second-years - philosophy student Elanin Vince and English and philosophy student Peter Medley.</p>
<p>There are also two pairs of candidates running for <strong>RAG Officer</strong>, and one candidate running on their own. Iszi Chew, a second-year studying Social Policy and Social Work, is the lone candidate.</p>
<p>Chew will be competing against Helen Fry and Zoe Stones &ndash; a biology student who is currently one of Derwent&rsquo;s Eco Reps and a music student who is currently one of Goodricke&rsquo;s Vice-Chairs, and Sarah Goss and Will Scobie &ndash; a first-year Environment student of Langwith College and a second-year history and politics student who ran for Vanbrugh Chair in this year&rsquo;s JCRC elections.</p>
<p>Running together for <strong>Campaigns Officer</strong> are Chris Etheridge, a politics student who has been elected York Tories Treasurer two years running, and Jason Rose, a astrophysics student of Langwith College who is a YUSU Trustee and works for URY.</p>
<p>Claire Cornock is running for <strong>Disability Officer</strong>. Cornock is a mathematics graduate studying a PhD in semigroup theory, and is also Captain of York Dancesport.</p>
<p>Sam Daniels and Suzi Ellis are running for <strong>Entertainments Officer</strong> on a joint ticket. Daniels is a second-year studying history and history of art and Ellis is second-year English student, currently secretary of Fusion.</p>
<p>Both candidates ran in this year&rsquo;s Alcuin JCRC elections, for Chair and Business and Services Vice-Chair respectively.</p>
<p>David Clarke, a first-year politics student from Langwith College, and Jade Flahive-Gilbert, a first-year music student, are running together for <strong>Environment and Ethics Officer</strong>.</p>
<p>Ellie Kuper Thomas, a second-year student, is running for <strong>Women&rsquo;s Officer</strong> with Amal Ali, a Philosophy student.</p>
<p>Running for <strong>Student Action Officer</strong> is Rachel Hesselwood, a psychology student who worked as Vanbrugh&rsquo;s Student Action Rep last year. There are no candidates for <strong>Racial Equality Officer</strong>.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Other Positions</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>David Levene, a second-year politics and sociology student who is Chair of the Labour Club, is running unopposed for <strong>Chair of Union Council</strong>.</p>
<p>There are 11 candidates competing to be the seven <strong>delegates</strong> for the NUS Annual Conference. In alphabetical order, they are Ali Allana, Michael Batula, Lewis Bretts, Daniel Carr, Rhianna Kinchin, Tom Langrish, Oliver Lester, David Levene, Charlie Leyland, Kath Mildon and Jamie Tyler.</p>

<p>&quot;Works for URY&quot; now? Hehe.</p>
<p>More information than the Nouse article, though you haven&#039;t listed the appropriate credentials for some. RAG Officer position has mostly RAG people there so I&#039;d have listed what they did for RAG, personally. I&#039;m sure that people will add on here their own credentials come tuesday <img src="../../../smileys/rasberry.html" alt="" /></p>

<p>Jason raises an interesting point. Three of the RAG candidates are very experienced in RAG matters.</p>
<p>It all looks very closely contested, although I&#039;d say there are clear favourites for all positions except Democracy and Services and President.</p>

			<p>I&#039;d say Langrish is clear favourite for President given that he has essentially gone through the constitution and wrote the bye-laws over the last term, was involved in the whole FTR campaign and has chaired YUSU Council (previously Senate) for a year whereas the others haven&#039;t got any YUSU experience. Granted that it&#039;s not clear-cut but I&#039;d say it puts him as clear favourite from the off.</p>
<p>Obviously Rory has an advantage but he doesn&#039;t have much RAG/Student Action experience so that&#039;s a downside too. Charlie has a fairly good chance <img src="../../../smileys/rasberry.html" alt="" /></p>
<p>And Sports is presumably highly-contested. I don&#039;t really know much about any of those candidates though so I can&#039;t suggest who&#039;s favourite.</p>

<p>&quot;Charlie has a fairly good chance.&quot; - understatement of the year, I think Jason <img src="../../../smileys/rasberry.html" alt="" /></p>
<p>I would say that Langrish is certainly a strong candidate but it&#039;s by no means clear cut. Ngwena is popular through Fusion and although Bushby and Bradley are relatively unknown outsiders as we saw last year, relatively unknown people can still win, especially if they pull out a strong campaign that can capture the attention of campus. It&#039;s far too early to tell.</p>

<p>President will be an interesting one. Tom Langrish is quite popular, and has far more experience than any of the other candidates, but he could suffer from being perceived as inside the YUSU Clique. He became YUSU training officer in his first year, and then Policy and Campaigns officer... but frankly, campaigning hasn&#039;t been as visible this year as it could have been. He seems to have more interest in YUSU generally than in campaigns or training.</p>
<p>Tim Ngwena is very popular and has done good things with fusion and bad taste. But he&#039;s got no YUSU experience and has never run an election campaign before.</p>
<p>I think Langrish has a fight on his hands, and it all comes down to who comes across best at hustings and how well they run their campaigns.</p>

<p>I think having &quot;Mad Cap&#039;n Tom&quot; say that there is always a clique and it can be beneficial is likely to lead to that being less of an issue than the previous two years.</p>
<p>Granted that he&#039;s not exactly been the most in-your-face Campaigns Officer but he was at the front of the Bar Campaign last summer, though didn&#039;t lead it in the public&#039;s eye, and I was surprised to see him join the demonstration yesterday for a little while. He&#039;s still there, helping out, even if he&#039;s not visible. Granted that it won&#039;t help him too much but it&#039;s a worthwhile point. He has campaigned and training is not his jurisdiction - he&#039;s Policy and Campaigns. We&#039;ve had a bar, full hours library, cheap bus tickets, etc. since he&#039;s been Campaigns Officer and on the policy front he has been instrumental in the new constitution that we&#039;ve only had since he became Pol&amp;Campaigns. He&#039;s also led Council more than Michael.</p>
<p>In the end it&#039;ll come down to the fact that Tom Langrish is very YUSU (though I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll be as much of a disadvantage as under other circumstances) whereas Ngwena and the others are not. Fusion reaches a lot of people and also take a lot of organisational skills, which is good for President, whereas running a radio show (i.e. the other two) doesn&#039;t take much effort. My show ticks along but I have the technical expertise of a five-year-old. I&#039;m sure that both of the other two candidates have many things that haven&#039;t yet been revealed but it&#039;ll be interesting to see how they play this campaign.</p>

<p>I&#039;m clarifying my reasoning as to why I think that he is, at the present time, the favourite. Whether he is when it comes to voting is up to their campaigning teams.</p>
<p>I&#039;m not saying that he&#039;d be a good president or a bad president compared to the others. I&#039;m saying that I think the key difference come election time is whether people think being majorly involved with YUSU is good or bad as he is and the others aren&#039;t. I&#039;m not campaigning and haven&#039;t said that any of the examples given above are good or bad. Just to clear things up.</p>
<p>People can make their own minds up as to whether the Campaigns Officer should have led the bar campaign or whether he should have stepped out of the limelight. It&#039;s personality and maybe that personality won&#039;t be good for President but maybe it would be. You guys decide.</p>
