		<div class="SubText">As we find ourselves at the end of another year at York, many of us will be homeward bound, leaving for travels abroad, gaining work experience or temping, whilst some of us will be thrust into the world of work. The Yorker takes a look back at some of the major events which define the academic year that was 2006-2007.</div>

        <p>Freshers&#039; Fortnight saw the likes of Viking Raid, Access All Areas, Comedy in Central Hall, and Fresh, with The Vengaboys, Basement Jaxx vocalist Vula and Radio One&#039;s Steve Lamacq, starting off the year in style.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Missing York student found dead</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>In early October, Robert Ailwood, a third-year York Archaeology student, was discovered dead in the River Foss, following a massive police operation after his disappearance on a night out the previous Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ailwood, aged 22, had been reported missing by his girlfriend after he failed to return home after a night out on Wednesday 11 October. Following his disappearance, a full-scale search began with local emergency service officers and a specialist police team including divers to search York&acirc;&euro;&trade;s rivers.</p>
<p></p>
<div style="float: right; width: 180px; padding: 2px"><a href="../../photos/full/375.jpg"><img src="../../photos/medium/375.jpg" width="180" height="145" title="Foss and Ouse" alt="Foss and Ouse"  /></a><div>River Foss</div></div>
<p></p>
<p>Nearly a week later, the body of a young male was discovered in the River Foss near the Blue Bridge next to the Foss Barrier in Fulford on Tuesday 17 October. The body was later confirmed to be that of missing Robert Ailwood. The coroner was unable to disclose whether the circumstances involving Ailwood&acirc;&euro;&trade;s death were suspicious.</p>

<ul><li><strong>University faces backlash over Portering cutbacks</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>York students were faced with another battle for services when the University announced the reduction of portering in late January. Students were told that the cutbacks were due to a staff shortfall of 14, 26% of the workforce, leading to full closures of Vanbrugh, Wentworth, and Derwent lodges.</p>
<p></p>
<div style="float: right; width: 180px; padding: 2px"><a href="../../photos/full/184.jpg"><img src="../../photos/medium/184.jpg" width="180" height="145" title="Langwith" alt="Langwith"  /></a><div>Langwith</div></div>
<p></p>
<p>The University claimed that the shortages were &acirc;&euro;&oelig;unforseeable&acirc;&euro;, much to the ridicule of students. After another arduous campaign, &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Save Our Porters&acirc;&euro;&trade;, the University announced it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s decision to return services to the October 2006 benchmark in early February. Protests had resulted in full services being restored to every college bar Langwith, where currently the lodge is closed during the night.</p>

<ul><li><em>In January, a group of students performed a silent rave in the University of York Library, seen by bemused onlookers!
</li></ul>
<p></em></p>

<ul><li><strong>Student convicted of rape</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>York Crown Court convicted English student Clive Manyou in late January of raping and sexually assaulting another student as she slept. Manyou, 36, raped a 19 year-old female student after &acirc;&euro;&oelig;manipulating&acirc;&euro; his way into her bedroom during the early hours of 8th  June 2006, after a night out at York nightclub Ziggy&acirc;&euro;&trade;s. Manyou was studying English and Related Literature at York, and was lead singer of campus band Mitus.</p>
<p>Manyou was in his first year at York when he was arrested on the 9th  June 2006 before being charged with rape on 28th  July 2006. In the intervening time Manyou continued to  play with Mitus at various campus events. Manyou was subsequently suspended from the University and sentenced to six years in prison at a trial in York Crown Court in January 2007.</p>

<ul><li><em>Anne-Marie Canning was voted President-Elect of the SU in March, after an election victory which saw her gain almost treble the amount of votes as rival James Flinders.</em>
</li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>Roses victory for York</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>The White Rose of York was once again victorious over The Red Rose of Lancaster at Roses 2007, in early May. York led the competition throughout, with only a short period where victory looked in doubt. Wins included sports such as swimming, sailing, equestrian, badminton, and cricket to name but a few!</p>

<ul><li><strong>Students found guilty of cheating</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>In May, two students were found guilty of fraud after one asked his friend to sit an exam on his behalf. Third year economics student Qiu Shi Zhang had asked his friend Xin Zhang on May 11th, but invigulators caught Xin after realising he did not  resemble the photo on the proof of identification. Both were sentenced at York Magistrates Court to 100 hours of community service and ordered to pay &Acirc;&pound;35 of court expenses. Qui Shi Zhang was subsequently suspended from the University.</p>

<ul><li><em>Meanwhile, students also celebrated the one year anniversary of Facebook&acirc;&euro;&trade;s arrival on the York University scene. Facebook now boasts approximately 20 million users around the globe, over 10,000 of which are in the York UK network, a true student craze.
</li></ul>
<p></em>
</p>
<div style="float: right; width: 180px; padding: 2px"><a href="../../photos/full/98.jpg"><img src="../../photos/medium/98.jpg" width="180" height="145" title="Hes East" alt="Hes East"  /></a><div>Heslington East</div></div>
<p></p>

<ul><li><strong>Heslington East gets go-ahead</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>The University finally received government permission to proceed with its &Acirc;&pound;500m Heslington East expansion onto Green Belt land, in June 2007. The project was given the all clear despite controversy over environmental implications and disruption to the general lifestyle of local residents.</p>
<p>The face of the university is set to change forever. The expansion will substantially increase the overall size of the University and facilities offered. The student population will increase by approximately 50% with new facilities  including a central student venue, swimming pool, and athletics stadium. The development will also see the addition of many new departments, including Law, and Theatre, Film and Television.</p>
<p>Vice Chancellor of the University, Professor Brian Cantor, who presided over the bid for expansion, welcomed the decision as beneficial for the University and the wider community. Building work is set to begin in spring 2008, with many calling for the University to provide an environmentally sustainable campus, a campaign headed by student society People and Planet.</p>

<p></p>

<ul><li><strong>Flooding causes chaos</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>In recent weeks, York has felt the impact of freak weather events, causing flooding on campus and the cancellation of the much anticipated event York Proms. Student organisers of the concert were thought to have lost a whopping &Acirc;&pound;40,000 after the cancellation was announced just an hour before the event was due to begin.</p>
<p>Cancellations were made after on of the two access routes for emergency vehicles flooded, whilst the other had a dangerously high water level which would have exceeded should other rainfall occur. Much of Rowntree Park had escaped immediate flooding but Health and Safety officials could not guarantee the safety of visitors, who were met with advice upon how to receive refunds upon arrival.</p>
<p>A collaboration of the talents of York students, BBC Radio York, and City of York Council, the event was to showcase 400 local performers, with all proceeds going to charity.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Woodstock 07</strong>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<div style="float: right; width: 180px; padding: 2px"><a href="../../photos/full/377.jpg"><img src="../../photos/medium/377.jpg" width="180" height="145" title="Woodstock" alt="Woodstock"  /></a><div>Woodstock was a success</div></div>
<p></p>
<p>Despite predictions of bad weather, York University&acirc;&euro;&trade;s biggest outdoor live music event, RAG Woodstock, went ahead on Saturday of Week 9. Woodstock involved 12 hours of live music split between two stages and was headlined by Make It Better Later, Fenna Rhodes and the True Ingredients, Accept Instruction, and Apply the Breaks.</p>
<p>Not to mention the overwhelming contribution of many student societies, resulting in the event achieving its fundraising target of &Acirc;&pound;5000, to be split between 10 beneficiaries.</p>
<p><strong>As we leave our now slightly sodden campus for three months, some of us forever, we can look back at some of these events as defining times of our York student experience. Whether you are off too see the world, off to start your career, or off back home for comfort, <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> wishes all readers a fantastic summer and best of luck to this year&acirc;&euro;&trade;s graduates, the class of 2007.</strong></p>
