		<div class="SubText">As Halifax College goes to the polls to elect the Halifax College Student association (HCSA) officers, the Yorker asked the candidates why Halifax should choose them.</div>

        <p>Over 40 candidates are standing, although some are running on a joint ballot. As the College is festooned with posters and some slogans were recently seen on walls in snow, there is a lot going on this election season.</p>
<p>The current President of Halifax said of the elections: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really exciting to have so many contested positions in our elections this year! I think its going to be a really close race, especially for the
top positions. Everyone is throwing as much as possible into campaigning, despite the bad weather! Hopefully voting turn-out will recognise the hard work of all the candidates!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> interviewed the five candidates for President of the committee; Pav Dhande, Arthur Barrow, Daveds Mootanah Byron Karemba and Ozge Bektasoglu.</p>
<p><span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> : What made you decide to run for president?</p>
<p><strong>Dhande:</strong> I love Halifax to bits, and have seen some good things over the last year. I&#039;ve also seen things that need improving, and I feel I&#039;d be best suited to bring about this change. I&#039;ve already heavily been involved in college life, and want to serve to give back what I&#039;ve been given.</p>
<p><strong>Moontanah:</strong> My grandfather once told me when I was a young island boy growing up in my native Mauritius, that I would have to choose between the papaya and the papaya seed. I chose the papaya seed and grew a papaya tree to feed my whole family (all 38 of them). I consider Halifax College as my extended family and would like to plant the necessary creative resources that will be key to the growth of success for Halifax College.</p>
<p><strong>Karemba:</strong> I decided to run for HCSA president because I thought my candidacy would address some of the issues that would not be picked up on by the other candidates. Secondly all the other candidates are second and third years so as a first year running I represent all the freshers in Halifax.</p>
<p><strong>Bektasoglu:</strong> I ran for this position so I can make a significant difference to the college, and ensure that the HCSA is run effectively and can give the best services to students, especially next year&#039;s freshers.</p>
<p><strong>Barrow:</strong> I want to make things better in Halifax.</p>
<p><span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> : What are your main policies?</p>
<p><strong>Dhande:</strong> My policies are split into three main categories, and then an additional online section. Entertainment: create an event to out-do Big-D, and get even bigger events all year including through Halifax on Tour. Also make sure we&#039;re providing enough nights-in for those that don&#039;t just want to go clubbing. Welfare: free condoms to be available from the porters, fortnightly open hours in JJs for feedback on the college, promote campus welfare services
such as Nightline and Open Door, and hand sanitizer for bathrooms without sinks. Involvement: get YUSU officers to hold sessions with students in JJs once a term for direct access, welcome societies to hold open days in JJs, inter-court sporting events and bring the college cup home! Online: re-design our website and presence online.</p>
<p><strong>Moontanah:</strong> To introduce/continue introducing creative, original events to Halifax College that all other colleges will go on to follow and to maintain successful events. These -out of many - include: &#039;Fax off to Amsterdam, Halifax Take Me Out II, Halifax Vs Salvation Paintball Staff &amp; Doormen, Halifax Culture Society BBQs for summer with free food + DJ, Halifax Sports Charity Week...the keyboard can&#039;t handle this much fun. Look on my facebook event page.</p>
<p><strong>Karemba:</strong> My main policies centre around reform of the HCSA itself, it is not visible enough and not accessible to Halifax residents. Secondly my other policies address the issue of YUSU control over Halifax events. I aim to make YUSU more accountable to students in Halifax and other colleges.</p>
<p><strong>Bektasoglu:</strong> My policies cover every aspect of the college from environment and charity, to ents and welfare however my main policies are to continue the success of events from last year and improve college spirit and integration as well as bringing Halifax back to the top in terms of sport.</p>
<p><strong>Barrow:</strong> To get everyone together. To make the most out of JJ&#039;s. To be fully listening to the ideas and problems of the students living here.</p>
<p><span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> : What plans do you have for your time in office?</p>
<p><strong>Dhande:</strong> Lydia has made some great changes to the structure of the HCSA, and I want to make sure the new sub-committees have some sense of direction from the start. I intend on guiding these teams and supporting them to do the best that we can in all three key areas: involvement, welfare and
entertainment. I want to be around the college so that residents can approach the HCSA without hesitation.</p>
<p><strong>Moontanah:</strong> For Welfare, my policies will be to promote and enforce free bike rental for Halifax Students, events notice boards for each court to reduce facebook event messaging assaults, enforce instalment of new pool table in JJs, to integrate Hickleton and Ainsty court much more in all activities
and much more on my facebook event page (on.fb.me/votedaveds).</p>
<p><strong>Karemba:</strong> My plans in office will not only centre around social events but I will actively encourage intra college sport and non social events as well.</p>
<p><strong>Bektasoglu:</strong> Various projects such as bringing more campus facilities to Halifax, i.e.
selling bike locks and printer credits in Halifax, as well as court vs. court events and college vs. college events to give students the biggest and best events possible.</p>
<p><strong>Barrow:</strong> To run events 4 days out of 7 including tea club. Improve the STYC system. Make sure inter house and inter court tournaments take place. Unite everyone.</p>
<p><span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> : Why should be people choose you?</p>
<p><strong>Dhande:</strong> I have vast experience in chairing groups of students, varying from sizes of 6 to 150. This has involved organising monthly gigs, setting up campaigns and getting a group of us to South Africa for charity. I can bring that experience to Halifax straight away. I was also awarded Halifax Resident of the Year last year for being involved in the college.</p>
<p><strong>Moontanah:</strong> I am one of the only two candidates to have been on the Halifax Committee for the year and I therefore fully understand how the collegiate system works, what needs to be done and what is already in plans to be done. The other candidates do not benefit from any of this knowledge, unfortunately.</p>
<p>On top of this, one should simply look at my past record of success for the HCSA - all projects I have organised last year have been sell-out and profitmaking. I have therefore been an important character in bringing money into Halifax College.</p>
<p>So, with me as Halifax Chair, there is no risk involved. I have proved my worth, time and time again. It&#039;s time to CHANGE this college further with new ideas to improve college atmosphere, introduce bigger and better events, and generally to broaden horizons for a slick college experience!</p>
<p><strong>Karemba:</strong> Halifaxians should chose me over the other candidates because I am the only candidate with a detailed plan on how to carry out some important changes in how the HCSA operates and make it more relevant to Halifax students. Additionally the other candidates have roles in YUSU and
won&#039;t be able to independently represent Halifax against unfair or irrational YUSU decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Bektasoglu:</strong> Not only am I one of the only candidates to have relevant experience on the HCSA, I also
have experience as a House Captain which was a very similar job to President and the relevant knowledge to lead the HCSA next year.</p>
<p><strong>Barrow:</strong> I want to listen to all opinions and ideas. Living on site, this will make it easier to do so. Therefore, I can get HSCA to help immediately should it be necessary.</p>
<p>Of course many other positions are open besides that of President. A full list of Candidates is below:</p>
