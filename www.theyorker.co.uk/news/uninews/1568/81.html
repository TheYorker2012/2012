		<div class="SubText">The Yorker team complete their live coverage by bringing you the news that our new SU team is to be led by a pirate.</div>

        <p><strong>1:35:</strong> To <em>Summer of 69</em>, we finish our coverage. Check back over the next few days for further coverage and comments.</p>
<p><strong>1:30</strong>: SU President candidate Nadz Kunwar tells <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>: &quot;I&#039;ve had so much fun campaigning, it&#039;s a shame to lose.&quot;</p>
<p></p>
<div style="float: right; width: 180px; padding: 2px"><a href="../../../photos/full/1630.jpg"><img src="../../../photos/medium/1630.jpg" width="180" height="145" title="pirate wins" alt="pirate wins"  /></a><div>The pirate wins the SU election</div></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1:20</strong>: <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> secured the first quote from our new SU President, when we asked how he felt. He replied: &quot;I&#039;m about to pass out.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>01:18</strong>: Joe Clarke said: &quot;At this time, it seems like a mockery.&quot; However, Tom Scott said: &quot;People keep asking me, am I going to take the job and the answer is Yes. I be doing the best damn job I can.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>01:14:</strong> And now for the big one... 2984 people voted for this postion. AMC described having to announce this fact as her proudest moment as president. The winner is Mad Captain Tom Scott. Some members of the audience are singing &quot;We want our vote back&quot;. Theresa Dolan said: &quot;This uni is a sham!&quot;</p>


<h3> President </h3>

<p><strong>Candidates:</strong></p>

<ul><li>Tom Scott

</li><li>Laura Payne

</li><li>Nadz Kunwar
</li></ul>

<p><strong>01:03:</strong> Matt Burton becomes the first officer to serve two years running. He said: &quot;I&#039;d like to thank all my campaigners. I really think I can do it. Thank you very much to my Sabbs, everyone has been really really supportive, even the people at the front. Thanks, enjoy the night.&quot; A song specially requested by Matt Burton is played. No one at <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> has a clue what it might be. Joe Clarke said: &quot;A landslide victory for the deserving candidate.&quot;</p>

<ul><li>Matt Burton

</li><li>James E J Thompson

</li><li>Nick Bradley
</li></ul>

<p><strong>12:54:</strong> Current AU President Jo Carter has explained the situation. A drunk member of the audience pressed a button on the slide. They went through normally as they were unsure how many members of the audience had seen the slide. Carter has been round and apologised personally to all candidates. Doorsafe are now guarding the computer to avoid the event happening again.</p>
<p><strong>12:51:</strong> AMC was just spotted falling into the recycling bins. We&#039;re currently trying to get hold of her for a reply.</p>
<p><strong>12:47:</strong> Sam McCormmick said: &quot;It&#039;s a disgrace that they didn&#039;t offer an apology, they should have rushed through the results rather than brush them under the carpet. They&#039;re messing with people&#039;s lives there.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>12:42:</strong> We&#039;re almost there folks, only two more results to announce. However, we&#039;re thirsty, will someone buy us a pint?</p>
<p><strong>12:37:</strong> AMC told the audience ex-Academic and Welfare officer Grace Fletcher-Hackwood texted in and said: &quot;This is the best job in the Union.&quot; AMC added: &quot;I agree with her, it is the best job, and the most important.&quot; The post got a large number of votes with 2373 votes cast.</p>


<h3> Academic and Welfare Officer</h3>

<ul><li>Alan Duffell

</li><li>Charlie Leyland

</li><li>Matthew Pallas

<p><strong>12:33:</strong> The results have now been announced officially. After first round Collinson 535, Lacy 642, Coney 545. After second round Collinson 593, Lacy 662, Coney 563. Third round Collinson 658, Lacy 723, Coney 606. Last round is Collinson 790, Lacy 856. Lacy wins an extremely close contest.</p>
<p><strong>12:29:</strong> Another unfortunate mistake... Result went up before any annoucements were made. Alex Lacy is new AU president<strong></strong></p>


<h3>AU President</h3>

<p><strong>Candidates:</strong></p>

<ul><li>Alex Lacy

</li><li>Jack Kennedy

</li><li>Aimee Gamble

</li><li>Chris Collinson

</li><li>Max Coney
</li></ul>
<p><em>The winner is Alex Lacy</em></p>
<p><strong>12:25:</strong> New Ents Officer Naomi says she feels &quot;OK&quot;, then &quot;Good&quot; and finally settles for &quot;Excited about the year to come&quot;. Baywatch themes comes on. It&#039;s like Toffs on a Tuesday night, except I&#039;m using my laptop and nowhere near as drunk...</p>
<p><strong>12:09:</strong> Shanks, who won with yet another convincing result, told the audience: &quot;Thank you very much. I&#039;d like to thank all those who have voted for me and have helped me along the way. I&#039;d like to thank my house, my OTC attachment, the campaigns we all ran were great, which is great for communications.&quot;</p>

<p></p>


<h3>Societies and Communications</h3>

<p><strong>Candidates:</strong></p>

<ul><li>Matt Harris

</li><li>Chaz Taylor

</li><li>Rory Shanks
</li></ul>
<p><em>The winner is Shanks with 923 votes, above the threshold of 871 and half.</em></p>
<p><strong>12:06:</strong> With a massive threshold of 927, Jamie Tyler won SDC with a landslide 937 votes, without the need for a second round of voting. The Derwent crowd chants &quot;Tyler, Tyler, Tyler&quot;. Tyler said: &quot;You guys are all amazing, I love you all.&quot; Witts won James College, the only one Tyler failed to win.</p>


<h3>Student Development and Charities</h3>

<p><strong>Candidates:</strong></p>

<ul><li>Jamie Tyler

</li><li>Sarah Witts

</li><li>Fran Olley
</li></ul>
<p><em>The winner is Jamie Tyler</em></p>
<p><strong>11:55:</strong> Rich Croker, ex-YUSU President tells us: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think students are voting for the pirate, they&rsquo;re voting for RON. The pirate is the new RON. Students aren&rsquo;t voting for him as a candidate, more someone who isn&rsquo;t the typical SU.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prior to the Presidential Battle of Croker&rsquo;s era, the exit poll had never been wrong. After a change from a three-day analysis of 300 votes, to a one day, 100-sample exit poll, the result was wrong in its first year (the election of 2006/7). Although Croker said: &ldquo;A win of a maximum of 10% on the exit poll gives you your winner.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>11:43:</strong> Langrish told the audience: &quot;I don&#039;t think the result actually reflects the level of effort put into the election.&quot; Meanwhile the pirate and his crew are tearing the dancefloor to pieces with their probably illegal moves.</p>
<p><strong>11:40:</strong> The results coming thick and fast. Langrish and Batula miss first round of voting by 1.5 votes despite winning in every college except James College, but end up winning in the second round by a landslide.</p>

Meanwhile Aimee Gamble, surprise entrant in the race for the AU told us that her nomination was all down to Matthew Pallas. She gave her blank nomination form to Pallas who signed her up - she says her aim for the night is to simply beat RON (as she isn&#039;t actually a member of the AU).</p>
<p><strong>10:09:</strong> The announcer has requested &quot;everyone to report to the dancefloor&quot;. Currently no one has responded, in fact Joey Ellis and Matt Burton have just departed.</p>
<p><strong>10:05:</strong> Mitch: Yes I do. Anon: Official times are 12.15am for AU and 1am for SU President. As the event is running over half an hour late, I couldn&#039;t possibly say.</p>

<p>York the laughing stock of other unis because we have a &quot;pirate president&quot;? Au contraire, I think that his election serves to put things in perspective a little... Living in our litte uni-verse we tend to forget that Campus politics aren&#039;t everything.</p>
<p>YES, YUSU is important for our welfare and for the future of the uni, but NO the world will not suddenly lapse out of existence because a candidate whom at first appeared to run as a joke, won.</p>
<p>Indeed, I think we shouldn&#039;t dismiss him this quickly-- I do believe the mention &quot;actually competent&quot; on his posters was very telling... He showed he was just as apt as anyone in raising issues students cared about... without being so damn serious about it.<br />
Scott has shown a keen sense of analysis -- esp with respects to relationship between YUSU pres and Vice-chancellor, cf his <a href="http://yorkuk.facebook.com/group.php?gid=24147917048">facebook group</a></p>
<p>All in all, it may a little cringing, but I look forward to next year!</p>

<p>I think it&#039;s a little harsh to dismiss &#039;student politics&#039; as uncared for!</p>
<p>It may not be the harsh wide world but university is a place for people to flourish in the best environment possible; something the YUSU board should endeavour to achieve.</p>
<p>Laughing stock is a bit extreme but it would be nice to think we might be taken seriously by other universities. This will no doubt attract a degree of attention that it wouldn&#039;t if a &#039;normal&#039; person got in. I don&#039;t know enough to proclaim a well-rounded view but on first impression this may not be a good thing.</p>

<p>@ #82 Good one! given that many people *at York* don&#039;t really care bout YUSU, it&#039;s unlikely many people outside would...</p>

<p>I see a lot of people saying how awful this is. Has it occurred to you that Tom Scott won because he appealed to the majority of students who wouldn&#039;t normally vote? Truth is the other candidates appealed only to the &#039;political circle&#039; if you will - those who are in and around YUSU at the moment.</p>
<p>I see comments along the lines of &#039;students voted for him just to spoil the ballot&#039;. Sounds pretty stupid in my opinion... I voted for him because I, and I suspect a lot of other students, feel disillusioned with YUSU and how it works. Does that count as spoiling the ballot? Or does it count as democracy, because I also think he&#039;s the best candidate for the job?</p>
<p>In the end I reckon he&#039;ll be a breath of fresh air for YUSU. Give the man a chance, he&#039;s been voted in by the *majority* of students. That&#039;s democracy - I&#039;m afraid you can&#039;t argue with it Dan. Or perhaps you&#039;re planning to hound him out of position?</p>

<p>Some would argue that&#039;s precisely the problem with democracy...<br />
But in this case I think it&#039;s worked out ok. #86 sums it up quite well, Scott won because he thoroughly made his presence known around campus and thereby appealed to those whom wouldn&#039;t normally have voted.</p>

<p>Ok, why are people bothered. This is president of YUSU not president of the world. Its not really like they make any difference to anyones lives or anything. All this &quot;call for his resignation&quot; makes me laugh *ha ha ha*<br />

<p>First of all i didn&#039;t vote Scott but whether you want him as President or not, he isn&#039;t going to be running a pirate-themed-dictatorship, YUSU work as a team and a pretty large team have just been elected.

<p>I think we should give him a chance, yes he positioned his campaign as a novelty; but lets give him a chance. I didn&#039;t vote for him, I actually voted RON, as I thought none of the candidates was any good.<br />
Perhaps this will spur a renewed interest in university politics; with a surge of people next year wanting to improve after what may or may not be a good year for YUSU. Whatever the year holds, it will be interesting!</p>

<p>If he doesn&#039;t make it a &#039;pirate-themed-dictatorship&#039; then that&#039;s definitely a step in the right direction. Laughing stock: yes perhaps too extreme. &#039;Cringing&#039; from Marie was a more apt turn of phrase perhaps.</p>
<p>Has it occurred to you that Tom Scott won because he appealed to the majority of students who wouldn&#039;t normally vote?</p>
<p>Very good point...at least it&#039;s gained interest from people not normally interested in student politics to cast a vote.</p>
<p>Good luck to him and let&#039;s hope that his &#039;pirate&#039; status won&#039;t hold him back if he has actually got genuinely good policies. They seem to be undermined by his comical persona but perhaps that&#039;s the point...to give some authoritative people a decided, and some would suggest much needed, ego check.</p>

<p>Fair points. I accept that maybe my post came accross as a little extreme (just the journalist in me fighting to come out :-D) and I truly hope that Tom can prove me wrong and effect positive change in the University. Good luck to him... Looking forward to seeing some non-pirate themed policies or motions from him soon. I also agree that recently student politics has seen a massive increase in interest and although Grace seems to have sparked that, the Pirate campaign should take some credit and that can only be a good thing.</p>

<p>First off the anti-pirate comment stink of a ninja coup!</p>
<p>Secondly.... this is fantastic. The students have spoken! No to boring old YUSU cliques. YES TO FUN!</p>
<p>I suspect most of <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span> regulars will have voted for Nadz and Payne as they seem to take campus politics seriously! However, most students voted for the Pirate because they were fed up of taking student politics seriously...</p>

<p>Anon #94 (whoa, people like <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> don&#039;t they?!), I think the pirate winning has made it pretty clear this is just an almighty popularity contest; he may have great policies but ultimately he won because he was a big joke, let&#039;s face it.</p>

<p>At lot of the arguments against Tom Scott are as watertight as a plughole (yes I use his real name cos I know him as a real person, which I get the feeling most nay-sayers don&#039;t)</p>
<p>People who claim he&#039;s a joke candidate clearly don&#039;t know him. He&#039;s actually an incredibly clever, reliable, confident guy, and frankly the fact he advertised with joke policies shows a very good point about how no candidate really keeps their word on what they say they&#039;ll do. Which is politics through and through, really. If anything this just means he plans to keep running YUSU the way it is, which is hardly a bad thing.</p>
<p>He said he&#039;d do the best job he could and to write him off now is unreasonable. My personal opinion is that over time Tom will phase out the pirate thing as people won&#039;t find the gimmick funny anymore, and will save it for only the most important occasions. In which case what&#039;s the problem??</p>
<p>If the uni population at large really felt he was a joke they wouldn&#039;t have voted for him, so he must be doing something right. Best o&#039;luck to him</p>

<p>In which case he will be someone who lied in his election campaign...he won&#039;t be the &#039;pirate president&#039; he&#039;ll just be the president who got elected by lying to people. That is a problem isn&#039;t it?</p>
