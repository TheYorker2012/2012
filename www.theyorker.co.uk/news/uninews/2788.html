		<div class="SubText">The Yorker talks to York Sport President candidates Gemma Johnson, Michael Leahy, Kath Mildon, Emily Scott and Michael Sneddon.</div>

        
<ul><li><strong>Relevant experience?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Gemma Johnson:</strong> I am the President of the Riding Club and Team Captain of the Equestrian Team, as well as the Press and Publicity for YUsnow, and York Sport Tournament Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Leahy:</strong> I&#039;ve held the positions of Lacrosse Merchandise Rep (06/07), Lacrosse Treasurer (07/08), AU Tournament Secretary (07/08), Lacrosse Mens 1sts Vice Captain (08/09) and York Sport Treasurer (08/09).</p>
<p><strong>Kath Mildon:</strong> I have plenty of experience organising and playing university, college and recreational sport. I was University Ladies Tennis Captain as an undergraduate as well as Lacrosse Club Treasurer, and am currently a Graduate Student Association (GSA) Sports Officer and Wentworth Sports Rep. This year I&#039;ve been successful in getting more postgraduates involved in sport, particularly female and international students. I&#039;ve started up a netball club, yoga classes and am working with York Sport volunteers to pilot a &#039;yoga and kids club&#039; later this month. As an officer and trustee of the GSA, I&#039;m actively involved in discussion and decision-making in Executive Committee Meetings. Outside of sport, I&#039;ve worked in project management, finance and teaching, as well as being a research student. I haven&#039;t held a position on the York Sport Executive Committee, which I think helps me have a more flexible view of what the organisation should be doing for students, rather than what it&#039;s currently doing.</p>
<p><strong>Emily Scott:</strong> Halifax Sport Rep &#039;07, &#039;08 &amp; &#039;09, Women&#039;s Cricket Treasurer 07/08, Women&#039;s Cricket Captain 08/09, Hockey President 08/09, York Sport Ordinary Member 08/09</p>
<p><strong>Michael Sneddon:</strong> In the last year and a half I have been Sports Editor of <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> and York Vision. This has given me a good knowledge of university and college sport.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Why are you running?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>GJ:</strong> I am running for this position because our academic status as a university is not reflected by our sporting achievements. We have so many people who excel at sport but they do not have the facilities to train, neither do they have the financial backing. We are now five years behind Leeds University in terms of sporting achievements and this is just not acceptable. I genuinely want to make a difference, not just to teams and clubs, but to individuals and to improve sport at York University.</p>
<p><strong>ML:</strong> I am running because I know I am the best person for the job. My experience of sport at York over the past three years and my passion for playing sport has given me drive to improve the standard and reputation of sport at York. I feel that we already excel ourselves for an institution of our size and financial backing, but I feel we still have a long way to go and I am committed to increasing York Sport&#039;s profile, and its ranking in the BUCS league.</p>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> I want to help people enjoy their time at university through taking part in sport. I&#039;m passionate about improving inclusion as well as achievement, which I think can be quite a rare combination of qualities for a York Sport President. I feel I have the maturity and experience to really make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>ES:</strong> I am committed to helping further sport at York in any way I can. I am passionate about sport at the university, both at college and university level. I have wanted to run for this position since first year and am really determined to do a good job if elected.</p>
<p><strong>MS:</strong> I am running to try and put the emphasis of York Sport back on sport. I want the university sides winning promotions and winning cups through improved communication and support from York Sport. At college level, I would like to see participation increased through better advertising.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Why should students vote for you?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>GJ:</strong> I honestly believe that I am the best person for the role. I know everyone will say that, but having been involved in multiple clubs as well as being on the York Sport Committee means that I have seen what is needed for successful leadership of sport at York and have a firm understanding of what is expected from the role.</p>
<p><strong>ML:</strong> Students should vote for me because I feel the wealth of experience I have would be perfectly suited for tackling the current problems with sport at York. I know the system well, and feel this would give me a great advantage in the further development of York Sport&#039;s aims and objectives.</p>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> You should read my Sport for All objectives at <a href="http://www.vikingkath.org.uk/">www.vikingkath.org.uk</a> and decide for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>ES:</strong> I am experienced, committed and realistic. My pledges are not impractical. I would have more transparency between York Sport and the sports clubs, coinciding with better communication and a termly General Meeting for all the clubs to attend. I would continue to strengthen links with campus media to give York&#039;s sportsmen and women the recognition they deserve. I&#039;d like to promote the link between college and university level sport more, working with next year&#039;s VP to do this.</p>
<p>I would also like to have a reduced York Sport/Sports Centre membership for those who join later than halfway through the year (most likely &pound;35 instead of &pound;40). I would aim to improve the relationship with the Sports Centre to try and help members get more for their money. I would bring back Varsity and use it as a good warm up for Roses. I would try and win Roses by providing extra funding for extra training and coaching for clubs in the lead up to the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>MS:</strong> York Sport needs shaking up and I represent a change from the current system.</p>

<ul><li><strong>The best thing I&#039;ve done at uni is...</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>GJ:</strong> On a personal level, being involved with the UYRC has given me the opportunity to compete at a national level, captain a wonderful group of girls, enjoy a full social calendar and help those who share a passion for horses and riding. Enabling other students to develop their riding skills, and working alongside a dedicated committee, have been my greatest pleasures at university.</p>
<p><strong>ML:</strong> Earning selection to represent England Universities North at lacrosse.</p>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> Run as a candidate in this election. It&#039;s opened my eyes (and now hopefully yours) to how things are with sport here and how things could be made better.</p>
<p><strong>ES:</strong> Being a Halifax sports rep when we first won the inter-college sport championship was pretty special. Winning it for the second consecutive year was also amazing. We&#039;ll see what happens this year...!!</p>
<p><strong>MS:</strong> Become a student journalist. I&#039;ve made a lot of friends through it (more friends than enemies I hope) and writing articles has become a welcome release from economic equations.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Any Guilty Pleasures?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Driving to campus when I only live ten minutes away?</p>
<p><strong>ML:</strong> Sleep. It&#039;s fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> Cheddar cheese - I&#039;m from Somerset so quite appropriate!</p>
<p><strong>ES:</strong> Umm, I still have my childhood teddy!</p>
<p><strong>MS:</strong> Harry Hill&#039;s TV Burp, that and Nigel Reo-Coker.</p>

<ul><li><strong>What difference do you think you can make if you were to be elected?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>GJ:</strong> There are many flaws in the current system and I have to say that although media coverage of sport at the University has increased, there are so many things that we need to improve on, for instance, transport arrangements, the timetabling of facilities, maintenance of current facilities, lack of equipmen t- all these things need looking into. It&#039;s going to be hard work, it&#039;s not about me making my mark, it&#039;s about the sport, and I&#039;m so willing to make a difference for the better.</p>
<p><strong>ML:</strong> I&#039;d look at further developing college sport, and do more to improve York&#039;s ranking in the BUCS standings.</p>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> I want to bring in some new ideas which get people enjoying sport at a grass-roots level. A supply of sports equipment that people can borrow and use with their friends informally; fun sports sessions in the evenings and weekends which can be booked week-by-week; bicycle hire for those who don&#039;t have their own; a small fruit cafe in the sports centre selling and distributing fruit to matches; a proposal for a water sport facility on the lake at Heslington East.</p>
<p>There is currently too great an emphasis on those players who are reaching the top level of sport at the university. College-level and recreational sport is neglected. Week after week outdoor college fixtures have been cancelled because the pitches are not well-maintained. Traditionally college sport has been left almost entirely to the non-sabbatical vice-president meaning not enough time and resources are put into this area. College JCRs have been forced to buy their own equipment, despite paying to play college sport. I will work to ensure that sport at this level is properly financed and that people are properly informed about it through an improved version of the York Sport website. Achievement in sport isn&#039;t just about winning matches.... it&#039;s about helping people to join in, gain new skills, increase self-confidence and build friendships.</p>
<p><strong>ES:</strong> I would be a friendly, approachable candidate and would hope anyone would feel happy to come and talk to me with any problems or suggestions about York Sport. I would work hard to help sport at York in any way I could.</p>
<p><strong>MS:</strong> I am all about the sport. I believe that I would make the York Sport President a much more approachable figure and I would definitely listen to the clubs more.</p>
<p><strong>QUICK-FIRE</strong></p>

<ul><li><strong>Lager, wine or cocktails?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Punch! All three in a plastic container</p>
<p><strong>ML:</strong> Half and half cider and lager, with a dash of blackcurrant.</p>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> It&#039;s a tough one between wine and cocktails.... probably cocktails, particularly those with a lychee flavour.</p>
<p><strong>ES:</strong> Wine (or cocktails to get a night going)</p>
<p><strong>MS:</strong> Lager</p>

<ul><li><strong>Horror, romantic comedy or action film?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>ES:</strong> Film night of action film early on followed by a horror then a nice rom-com to lighten the mood after! (This isn&#039;t cheating - I love all of them, very mood dependent though!)</p>
<p><strong>MS:</strong> What category does <em>Mike Bassett - England Manager</em> come under?</p>
<p><strong>ML:</strong> I&#039;m more of a rom-zom-com kind of guy</p>

<ul><li><strong>For the girls: Girly night in or big night out?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Big night out followed by girly night in</p>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> A big night out, especially on Saturday 14th March after the York Sport President is announced!</p>
<p><strong>ES:</strong> Both!! So tricky. Girly punch night in as warm-up to a big night out? Or a girly night in with pyjamas, popcorn and chocolate to recover from a big night out!</p>

<ul><li><strong>Quiet romantic weekend or big city holiday?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>MS:</strong> It would depend who I went on the romantic weekend away with. Shockingly, I am currently single (ladies take note) so a romantic weekend away does not seem appealing. I don&#039;t really like big cities that much either so I&#039;ll say I would prefer to go away to Carlisle on a Saturday afternoon.</p>
