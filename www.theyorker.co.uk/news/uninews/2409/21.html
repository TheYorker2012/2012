		</div>
		<div class="SubText">This time, The Yorker speaks to the Vanbrugh Chair candidates and learns a little more about their campaigns. </div>

        
<ul><li><strong>Why are you running?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Danielle Fill</strong>: I&#039;m running for Vanbrugh Chair because I believe in the collegiate system and feel I have the drive, passion, knowledge and experience to continue the great work the current JCRC has achieved! I want to make sure that Vanbrugh college spirit continues to grow so that the pressures of the YUSU bar and other external forces don&#039;t rid York University of its colleges!</p>
<p><strong>Will Scobie</strong>: I am running for Vanbrugh Chair because I feel the college has given so much to me over the last year, and I would like to give something back. I also feel that I have the experience to be Chair as I have worked in the European Parliament for the last two summers, and I was Chair of my Student Union in my Sixth Form College.</p>

<ul><li><strong>What do you think is the biggest issue for your college this year?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>DF</strong>: Obviously the YUSU bar opening in Langwith is going to make us need to work harder than ever!  Events are one of our biggest incomes and by already having to reduce the number of events we have because they are at much higher risk of making a loss, we will have a reduced budget to spend on Vanbrugh students.</p>
<p><strong>WS</strong>: I think the biggest issue facing Vanbrugh is the looming threat of the new Langwith SU bar which means that V bar needs to keep competitive. V bar is the heartbeat of Vanbrugh college, and if we lose that we lose part of our identity. Therefore we need concrete policies and commitments to keep V bar going strong.</p>

<ul><li><strong>What do you think is the biggest issue for the university this year?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>DF</strong>: The possible loss of the collegiate system! York prides itself on having colleges, it makes it different from most of the other universities in Britain. It gives opportunities that may not be there otherwise. For example when I tell friends at other universities that I organise campus events, they don&#039;t understand how I can because they don&#039;t have opportunities to do so.</p>
<p><strong>WS</strong>: The biggest issue facing the university is the need to retain our college structure and so not lose our college identities. With college bars closing down, we need our college structure more than ever as I feel they are the best way of keeping people involved.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Fire</strong></p>

<ul><li><strong>Key Policy</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>DF</strong>: To increase college spirit and give back what I have recieved as being part of Vanbrugh!</p>
<p><strong>WS</strong>: Sky TV for the JCR</p>

<ul><li><strong>Location Last Year</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>DF</strong>: Le Page</p>
<p><strong>WS</strong>: Barbara Scott Court, Block D</p>

<ul><li><strong>Previous role on JCRC</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>DF</strong>: Ents Rep</p>
<p><strong>WS</strong>: None</p>

<ul><li><strong>Favourite Vanbrugh Memory</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>DF</strong>: There&#039;s too many!</p>
<p><strong>WS</strong>: Standing in the smoking area at Tru at the start of this year with 40 or so freshers screaming, &quot;Vanbrugh till I die!&quot;</p>
<p><em>Vanbrugh elections are now open and close Friday Week 9.</em></p>

<p>speaking on behalf of #4, I can state he is by no means on the scobie campaign, having in fact voted &#039;ron&#039;. Yet he aptly highlights an increasingly significant sector of the vanbrugh populace who feel alienated and slightly nauseated by a very much apparent vanbrugh jcr &#039;clique&#039;, who at times can act in an aloof and arrogant manner. That said, I am by no means relating or blaming this &quot;disease&quot; on the tenure of matt oliver, who has been a very impressive chair, and who on all accounts doesn&#039;t display the self-importance previuosly insinuated, or either allow it to enter his meetings.<br />
  All that said, I am sure both Dani and Will have the potential to be admirable chairs, though I am slightly discouraged by the standard, cliche, and at times unrealistic and undesirable agendas put forward by both candidates. Yours sincerely, a concerned vanbrugh second year</p>

<p>We&#039;re a committee who happen to all be friends... is that what defines a &#039;clique&#039;?<br />
Does that make the football team, netball team, LGBT, NGS and any other society/group of people who spend time together outside of that society a &#039;clique&#039;?<br />
Our committee welcomes all Vanbrugh members to all its social events whether they be Volume events, student action challenges, coffee and cake drop in sessions or open meetings.<br />
This is not a definition of &#039;clique&#039; that i am aware of.<br />

<p>Or they&#039;re just concerned that the committee could potentially be run by someone who has never sat on it or attended an open meeting. Surely with any committee it&#039;s a good idea to have someone running it who at least knows how the committee works, else the committee will be having to teach and help them which is a waste of time. Particularly when this is already probably going to be the hardest year for the JCRC??</p>
<p>Maybe husting did get a little out of hand, but none of that was due to either contestant, and both believed it damaged them.</p>

<p>Its not simply a question of over-zealous questioning of a candidate. It was just sad to see the very people who apparently have shown &quot;real commitment&quot; to vanbrugh, shunning their responsibility by purposely attempting to stump and embarrass a candidate, in order to further their friends campaign. I don&#039;t by any way imply they shouldn&#039;t support dani or critically analyze the candidates, but they of all people should demonstrate a degree of professionalism that was obviously not apparent. This isn&#039;t the rant of a single person, but the heartfelt opinion of much of &quot;our&quot; college. x</p>

<p>ahh #28, you too seem to be suffering from the same disease as our &#039;beloved&#039; jcr royalty. Fair enough if Scobie was merely questioned on never being part of the jcr, but to subject an ass that sweet to the kind of abuse Scobie was subjected to is plain wrong, the man worked for the European Parliament for christ&#039;s sake! Any hoo, excluding Matt Oliver (who by the way is divine) the jcr are nothing but a group of jumped up second years, out to serve the needs of their own CV&#039;s, true or false no one would actually run for a place on our &#039;esteemed&#039; jcr if they didn&#039;t think it would improve image on graduating from uni. Am I the only one who finds the incessant &#039;Vote for me!&#039; campaigns completely nauseating and offensive, LEAVE ME ALONE!!</p>

<p>If you have problems with the makeup of your JCR, then you should stand and try and change it. I wonder how many of these anonymous contributors actually have done? (Good point made by Kate- someone unashamed to air their views in their own name). It&#039;s easy to name a group of people a &#039;clique&#039; just because you&#039;re not a part of them. It also seems pretty spineless, critcising a group of people who, inspite of being from a rival college, have to all intents and purposes, sought to further the interests of their college in many areas and done it very well (even if our events are still better in Derwent <img src="../../../images/smileys/rasberry.gif" alt="" />).</p>
<p>I don&#039;t know about what went on at Hustings, but it seems to me that a candidate who has zero JCRC experience will inevitably attract more questions and probably criticism than someone who has been on the JCRC before and expereinced. The whole &#039;victim mentality&#039; is pretty immature and actually quite unnatractive to potential voters, so I suggest it would be in your best electoral interests to snap right out of it asap.</p>

<p>Oh, and it&#039;s definitely subjective as to whether working for that bastion of democracy, efficiency and &#039;non-cliquyness&#039; (the EU parliament) makes someone suitable for the position of JCRC chair.</p>

<p>Accountable for what? If he is putting himself on the same playing field as someone who knows about the JCR works, why should he then not be asked specific questions? I think one of the main reasons that the current JCR is sceptical is due to the fact over the past year the JCR have faced many problems that have tried and tested their committment, such as failed events, which has sorted out who was really committed (who put the time and effort in) and who just wanted to put their time on the JCR as just a CV filler (those that were never seen again). There has then been an conserted effort from those in charge, such as Matt Oliver and (I&#039;m sorry to say) Dani Fill and the other ents reps, to turn the events around and rebrand which took a hell of a lot of hard work that those on the outside just do not see. The Volume brand has worked an absolute treat and has been a resounding success.</p>
<p>Anyway after a rather long rant, I hope I have clarified that JCR are not a &#039;like a pack of hyenas&#039; but are in fact concerned that the hard work we put in this year and the direction we have taken and the steps we have put in place to ensure success for the next JCR will not be undone. I&#039;m sure Scobie will be a great leader, but you don&#039;t pick some one who has never played football for your team straight to captain.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>VANBRUGH TIL I DIE!</p>

<p>A source close to the vanbrugh bigwigs has apparently let slip sensational confidential information on election results. All i&#039;m saying is that team dani&#039; probably best not show their presence  at vanbrugh tonight. William Scobie, a man, a legend, a chair.</p>

<p>I don&#039;t personally know what happened at the Hustings but I did hear about it second hand. Everyone here seems to think Will has taken a victim mentality about it. Actually I saw him yesterday smiling and very positive about his campaign. It is justified to ask him more questions because less is known about him, but unjust to criticise him before he has chance to respond.</p>
<p>I personally think both candidates would do a good job for Vanbrugh, and both would be dedicated and hard working. Good luck to both of you. At the end of the day, it&#039;s the votes that count.</p>
