				All the university&#039;s colleges will have new committee chairs next term			</div>
				<div class="Date">Thursday, 22nd December 2011</div>
		<div class="Author">
			<a href="../archive/reporter/586/index.html">Aimee Howarth</a><br />
		</div>
		<div class="SubText">With all JCRC election results now announced, The Yorker caught up with the seven new college chairs to ask them about the elections and what plans they have in store.</div>

        <p>The new chairs will take up their positions from January, supported by freshly-elected Junior Common Room Committees for 2012.</p>
<p><strong>Alcuin</strong></p>
<p>New Alcuin chair Pascal Dubois defeated opponent Wasim Akhtar by just 15 votes to claim his position at the head of the committee. Dubois said: &ldquo;It was obviously fantastic winning, especially after the moment&rsquo;s panic on hearing how many votes my opposing candidate had received. I think it&#039;s very largely down to the personal acquaintances you have made in your college not to mention the support from the former JCRC.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On his plans as chair, Dubois revealed his first steps will be to contact clubs in town to organise events for next term, as well as creating a new Alcuin Facebook group and getting rid of unused ones. He added: &ldquo;I wouldn&#039;t say I have any specific ground-breaking policies but I hold Alcuin&#039;s best interest at heart and will do my best to improve its performance in all areas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dubois will be supported by new vice chairs Abigail Watson and Philip Naylor, along with the rest of the new Alcuin JCR committee.</p>
<p><strong>Derwent </strong></p>
<p>Francesca Knight defeated Harry Pampiglione, Harry Dorrance-King, Flavio Newcomb and Edward Scwitzer to be elected as chair, with a winning margin of just 23 votes.</p>
<p>Knight, who will work alongside vice chairs Beth Finnie and Lucy Hoban, said of her election: &ldquo;I felt flattered that people voted for me! I think my previous commitment to Derwent and my policy about maintaining D bar as the heart of the college were the main factors in the result.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking about her plans for next term, she said: &ldquo;I am going to push for more and better security on our campus. I am also going to ensure Derwent has a strong events calendar for the next two terms, with more diverse and inclusive choices, of course starting the term off with our traditional Chav D. I am also looking forward to promoting upcoming RAG week as much as possible in Derwent.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Goodricke</strong></p>
<p>Outgoing welfare rep Emily Miller has been elected as chair, along with vice chairs Liam O&rsquo;Shaughnessy and Megan Cross. About her election, Miller said: &ldquo;I&#039;m still in a bit of a daze and come-down from all the energy of campaigning and results. I was thrilled to find out I&#039;d won - not just at the thought of being Goodricke Chair, but at the prospect of being at the head of such a promising committee.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>

<img src="../../images/prototype/news/quote_close.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
<br /><span class="author">Emily Miller, Goodricke Chair</span>
</div></blockquote><p>&ldquo;I would hope that my success is due to the fact that Goodricke students want a chair who is approachable, enthusiastic and dedicated to the college and see me as someone who fits this description. I can&#039;t wait to work with the incoming committee to make the Goodricke experience even greater this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking about her plans, Miller added: &ldquo;The first thing I intend to do is get budgets delivered to each area of the committee so that they can begin planning events as soon as possible. I also hope to work closely with the new Langwith committee to organise a wealth of inter-college events between us in preparation for their move to Hes East next year - we can show them exactly what we mean by &lsquo;Goodricke Spirit&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Halifax</strong></p>
<p>George Offer was unveiled as President after an uncontested election and will be in charge of the college for its 10th anniversary year, backed up by vice chairs Neil Dodd and Jonathan Pask.</p>
<p>About getting the position, Offer told <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>: &ldquo;It&#039;s fantastic to be elected, I&#039;m very grateful. I put it down to strong policies and good campaigning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added that next term one of his priorities will be to &ldquo;hold a by-election and continuing to work on reorganising the committee&rdquo;. Not all positions were filled in these elections and so the opportunity for students to get involved during the by-elections next term.</p>
<p><strong>James</strong></p>
<p>Laura Watson will become head of James College, with George Richards, Becky Gray and Luke Spindler as vice chairs, and Watson spoke to <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> of her joy at being elected: &ldquo;After the nerves of the entire evening and hearing my name called out...&#039;elected James College Chair: Laura Watson&#039; - it was absolutely overwhelming, I have never felt so happy in an instant that tears of joy ended up messing up my mascara!! I&#039;m over the moon.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<img src="../../images/prototype/news/quote_open.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
I am still pinching myself that I am now the James College Chair; I&#039;ve been dreaming of this
<img src="../../images/prototype/news/quote_close.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
<br /><span class="author">James College Chair Laura Watson</span>
</div></blockquote><p>&ldquo;I believe my winning factor was ultimately down to the amount of support I had during my campaigning week - these individuals I absolutely adore and cannot wish for better friends. I believe I put my heart and soul into my campaign - I organised a flash mob to the macarena in the Roger Kirk Galleria as a publicity stunt; I dressed as a Nanna in Club Salvation. I wanted my campaign to be different and unique. I am still pinching myself that I am now the James College Chair; I&#039;ve been dreaming of this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Watson aims to bring improvement to the college, including &ldquo;communication and organisation at an exceptional level&rdquo; starting with the JCRC. Watson added: &ldquo;I hope to make sure James College wins the Volunteering Cup and RAG cup and has extremely successful events (both on and off campus). I want other colleges to see us and envy us, making sure our motto is intact: &#039;Let them hate us, so long as they fear us&#039;.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Langwith</strong></p>
<p>Like Halifax, Langwith Chair Jack Baker was uncontested and there are numerous committee positions open for by-election next term, including Sponsorship and LGBT Officers.</p>
<p>Baker, currently the college&rsquo;s outgoing LGBT officer, revealed his delight at his election and told <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>: &ldquo;It felt beyond amazing to be elected to such a position on the committee of a great college. My previous position was so rewarding I couldn&#039;t help but want to give back. I feel like the one thing that separated me from RON was the fact that I bothered to turn up to campaign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking ahead to next term, with Craig Burnell and Jason Brandwood as vice chairs, Baker revealed that he will focus on the college&rsquo;s move to the Heslington East campus. &ldquo;My first act is to finalise plans with concerns to the Hes East bar - just one many crucial points to meet before our move,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p><strong>Vanbrugh</strong></p>
<p>Matt Stephenson has been elected as Vanbrugh Chair with a winning total of 201 votes and he doesn&rsquo;t believe that his lack of previous JCRC experience will be a disadvantage. He said: &ldquo;I am hugely passionate about Vanbrugh, as shown by all of the inter-college events I competed in, and I think that having a fresh face in the committee will be very beneficial. Getting this position means the world to me, and I know that with a committee as strong as the one elected last night we can make real change within Vanbrugh for the better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the winning factor was my visiting every block in Vanbrugh and trying to meet as many people as possible, explaining my policies and letting people get to know me better as a person and decide for themselves if they thought I would make a good chair.&quot;</p>
<p>Stephenson, who will be supported by vice chairs Kate Elliott and Ben Rodin, named his main policies as promoting college sport societies to &ldquo;help them to be as successful as possible&rdquo;, promoting music societies so all students can participate, and ensuring V-Bar becomes a successful hub for the college. He also wants to fight for a 24-hour porter service &ldquo;to create the safest and most helpful environment possible&rdquo;.</p>
