		</div>
		<div class="SubText">James College Chair Chet Khatu has been no-confidenced by the Junior Common Room Committee.</div>

        <p>Khatu, the surprise winner in the elections, was subject to a no-confidence vote by the JCRC at 7pm on Wednesday 18th June, and as such is no longer Chair of James College.</p>
<p>The motion, which was first on the agenda, was proposed by the Press and Publicity officer, Jonathon Caunce. He cited &quot;leadership issues&quot; as the reason for dismissal.</p>
<p>A <a href="../2036.html">Statement</a> released on Thursday morning said: &quot;We would like to reiterate that this decision was taken purely on professional grounds, and should not be viewed as a personal attack in any way towards Chet Khatu.&quot;</p>
<p>The voting, conducted by position rather than person, saw a final vote of 10-2 with 1 person abstaining.</p>
<p>The college&#039;s constitution, unlike all others, requires no notice or quoracy to be met. Colleges such as Goodricke require 4% of the college&#039;s population to be at a pre-determined meeting. However, the James JCRC constitution simply states:</p>
<p>&quot;A vote must then be taken (by position) whilst the officer is vacant of the room.  A simple majority will remove the officer(s) from the committee.&quot;</p>
<p>The post will now remain open until a replacement can be elected. Khatu was downbeat about the decision, as there is no appeals process in place.</p>
<p>In his <a href="../2031.html">Statement</a> to <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> he said: &quot;It seems ridiculous that mob rule has prevailed in what is supposed to be an all accommodating democratic system.&quot;</p>
<p>Goodricke Chair Joe Clarke said of the decision: &quot;Chet has done more for that committee and for bringing colleges together than any Chair could have. The amount of emails that have been going round from people as senior as Elizabeth Heaps [Pro-Vice Chancellor] praising him show the amount of respect that he has from Senior University Staff.&quot;</p>
<p></p>

<img src="../../../images/prototype/news/quote_close.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
<br /><span class="author">Zach Pepper</span>
</div></blockquote><p>He said it was a &quot;ridiculous decision&quot; and added: &quot;I&#039;m not sure on a committee level if they can hold it together. It seemed to me that Chet was doing that.&quot;</p>
<p>Clarke added: &quot;I&#039;m going to bring it up at our open meeting tomorrow night, and we [Goodricke College] will be re-evaluating our involvement with them over Freshers Week.&quot;</p>
<p>He issued a plea to James students to attend meetings and make their opinions heard. &quot;It&#039;s time for the students to get in touch with their JCRC, go to the meetings, and let the committee know that they&#039;re outraged.&quot;</p>
<p>The process by which he was removed is set to come under dispute. Clarke said: &quot;I think it&#039;s a flaw in the constitution. It&#039;s the most undemocractic decision ever been made, the fact it can be done at a closed JCR meeting, and only 10 positions, out of a college of however many people can vote is just undemocratic. The consitution needs re-evaluating immediately.&quot;</p>
<p>The timing of the move is thought to be critical as colleges are organising Freshers Week.</p>
<p>Langwith Chair Zach Pepper said: &quot;Chet&#039;s a great guy and a good mate of mine. He had big ideas for James College, and the University as a whole. He&#039;ll be a loss to student politics.&quot;</p>
<p>College Constitutions were expected to be one of the changes under the forthcoming Governance review of YUSU.</p>
<p>In the past month Khatu had successfully negiotated a Sky TV Package for the JCR as well use of the Roger Kirk Centre as an events venue for the college.</p>
<p>YUSU President Anne-Marie Canning said: &quot;The JCRC have conducted themselves impeccably with regards to following the constitution, a constitution passed by James College students.&quot;</p>
<p>She added: &quot;I believe James College have had a difficult year but I have absolute faith that the team of three vice chairs will prove to be very successful in leading the college activities.&quot;</p>

I think its completely cowardly expecially after the event. Posting anonymously does not detract from the fact its a personal attack on him. It just makes that personal attack on him anonymous, helping no-one but your spineless selves.</p>
<p>People often accuse me and one or two others of holding somewhat distinct opinions but not having the conviction or backbone to have them as yourselves is just disgusting. You loose all moral high-ground even if your reasons were justified. Sorry. I just dont agree with it.</p>

<p>A non-anonymous comment for you, in SUPPORT of what the JCR did:</p>
<p>Chet has showed no leadershp this year, pushing forward whims and personally driven ideas which he then expected the JCR to act on for him.<br />
He was 3 hours late to Quad Dash, took no part in the preparation or set up and got stoned in a hammock whilst the rest of the JCR worked hard on the running of what was a fantastic day.<br />
As has been said several times (yet no supporters of Chet have responded to) he has not attended a single freshers meeting - surely one of the most important jobs of the Chair?<br />
He has intimidated and belittled several members of the JCR and contrary to popular belief is not respected by the majority of the college.<br />
As for his performance on the Senate or other high level University committees - what does that matter when his performance within the college has been desperately disappointing?</p>
<p>I am not a JCR member, I have friends in both &quot;camps&quot; but I feel the JCR are being unfairly attacked. The utter hypocrisy of accusing the JCR of victimising or making a scapegoat of Chet, whilst haranguing the JCR for following constitution procedure is disgusting.</p>
<p>Chet has only himself to blame for this. And I&#039;m sure he knows that, considering how many times he has had to apologise to the JCR during his term.</p>

<p>Chet may have loved James, but James clearly didn&#039;t love him. And in student politics, it doesn&#039;t matter how much work you put in, if the power hungry people who want to be chair next year don&#039;t like you, then you&#039;re out.</p>

<p>Charlotte, you are the first person that has given reasoning for his departure and for that, I thank you. You will note that I not once said his departure might not have been valid, or the reasons not compelling enough for the motion to pass. My annoyance was at some anon. posts that have targeted him personally from a cowardly position. Now the result has come about, you should be &#039;humble&#039; in your victory and not kick a man when he is on the floor. That&#039;s just my view.</p>

<p>I would like to refer you to my previous posts. Attacking someone for anonymity is invoking the &#039;ad hominem&#039; fallacy, you are attacking the person, not their argument. It makes little or no difference whether someone posts anonymously.</p>
<p>You say that if someone makes a stupid, opinionated personal attack on Chet then it is cowardly to not say who they are. In fact, the problem is with what they have said- it is stupid and should be ignored.</p>
<p>Instead, you should consider the arguments within those anonymous posts that are being reasonable such as #20. If anything their anonymity is worrying inasmuch as it suggests that they are intimidated for voicing opposing arguments.</p>
<p>The ministry of justice remains committed to anonymity of witnesses.</p>

<p>I agree with Laura, and feel the comments are getting a bit far fetched, out of hand, and completely off the subject matter.<br />
As a member of the JCRC, I would much rather have dealt with this in the way that we have done- by posting a statement from the group as a whole, in order to prevent campus media quoting individual comments.<br />

<p>I would also like to make a promise to members of my college. Over summer (I&#039;m currently in the middle of revising for exams) I will be completely reviewing and revising the college constitution as I think this illustrates that parts of it may be in need of an update.</p>
<p>As a lot of people seem to care, why do only a select few people turn up to our JGMs and vote based on what they hear? If you want things to change, read the reviewed constitution once I&#039;ve finished it, come to the general meeting and vote accordingly with your opinion. That way the college constitution would not be out of line with member&#039;s views.</p>
<p>It is under my position description to maintain and uphold the constitution and it appears that flaws come about when part of the document not often used are advocated. I&#039;m sorry this did not come up before and I will do everything I can to change the document so that in the future we will have a more democratic and representative procedure for matters such as this.</p>

			<p>Although admittedly blissfully unaware of the ins &amp; outs of university/college politics, I would like to express my utter disgust of the cowardly actions of James JCRC. And it trully worries me that these people are &#039;the representatvies&#039; of so many students. One thing is certain, this is not something agreed with by many students.</p>
<p>Chet is an amazing guy, personally will go out of his way for other people &amp; has always been lovely &amp; friendly to me, a student who had troubles settling into university life. On a more professional note, Chet has gone above &amp; beyond the call of duty, doing so much for the college - things people seem to have forgotten.</p>
<p>Reiterating, i dont understand poltics, but surely the point of such committee is to echo the voice of the students? And we had absolutely no idea any of this hadnt even been thought. Why can this not go to student vote so we can make our own decisions. And not have the like of a handful (of seemingly immature, vindictive) people make decisions which effect us. Even if commitee trully did not believe Chet was fulfilling his role - it is a week before the end of term! Why has something not been done sooner? All this seems to do is attack an inspiring young man, leave James unprepared for Freshers week &amp; make a mockery of our college. Perhaps the JCR should b concentrating on more important things...</p>

<p>As a fellow James student I would just like to say I agree wholeheartedly with #96. Chet made an awesome Chair &amp; this saga has lead to me to loose confidence in University Politics.
