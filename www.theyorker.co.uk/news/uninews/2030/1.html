		</div>
		<div class="SubText">James College Chair Chet Khatu has been no-confidenced by the Junior Common Room Committee.</div>

        <p>Khatu, the surprise winner in the elections, was subject to a no-confidence vote by the JCRC at 7pm on Wednesday 18th June, and as such is no longer Chair of James College.</p>
<p>The motion, which was first on the agenda, was proposed by the Press and Publicity officer, Jonathon Caunce. He cited &quot;leadership issues&quot; as the reason for dismissal.</p>
<p>A <a href="../2036.html">Statement</a> released on Thursday morning said: &quot;We would like to reiterate that this decision was taken purely on professional grounds, and should not be viewed as a personal attack in any way towards Chet Khatu.&quot;</p>
<p>The voting, conducted by position rather than person, saw a final vote of 10-2 with 1 person abstaining.</p>
<p>The college&#039;s constitution, unlike all others, requires no notice or quoracy to be met. Colleges such as Goodricke require 4% of the college&#039;s population to be at a pre-determined meeting. However, the James JCRC constitution simply states:</p>
<p>&quot;A vote must then be taken (by position) whilst the officer is vacant of the room.  A simple majority will remove the officer(s) from the committee.&quot;</p>
<p>The post will now remain open until a replacement can be elected. Khatu was downbeat about the decision, as there is no appeals process in place.</p>
<p>In his <a href="../2031.html">Statement</a> to <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> he said: &quot;It seems ridiculous that mob rule has prevailed in what is supposed to be an all accommodating democratic system.&quot;</p>
<p>Goodricke Chair Joe Clarke said of the decision: &quot;Chet has done more for that committee and for bringing colleges together than any Chair could have. The amount of emails that have been going round from people as senior as Elizabeth Heaps [Pro-Vice Chancellor] praising him show the amount of respect that he has from Senior University Staff.&quot;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>

He had big ideas for James College, and the University as a whole. He&#039;ll be a loss to student politics.
<img src="../../../images/prototype/news/quote_close.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
<br /><span class="author">Zach Pepper</span>
</div></blockquote><p>He said it was a &quot;ridiculous decision&quot; and added: &quot;I&#039;m not sure on a committee level if they can hold it together. It seemed to me that Chet was doing that.&quot;</p>
<p>Clarke added: &quot;I&#039;m going to bring it up at our open meeting tomorrow night, and we [Goodricke College] will be re-evaluating our involvement with them over Freshers Week.&quot;</p>
<p>He issued a plea to James students to attend meetings and make their opinions heard. &quot;It&#039;s time for the students to get in touch with their JCRC, go to the meetings, and let the committee know that they&#039;re outraged.&quot;</p>
<p>The process by which he was removed is set to come under dispute. Clarke said: &quot;I think it&#039;s a flaw in the constitution. It&#039;s the most undemocractic decision ever been made, the fact it can be done at a closed JCR meeting, and only 10 positions, out of a college of however many people can vote is just undemocratic. The consitution needs re-evaluating immediately.&quot;</p>
<p>The timing of the move is thought to be critical as colleges are organising Freshers Week.</p>
<p>Langwith Chair Zach Pepper said: &quot;Chet&#039;s a great guy and a good mate of mine. He had big ideas for James College, and the University as a whole. He&#039;ll be a loss to student politics.&quot;</p>
<p>College Constitutions were expected to be one of the changes under the forthcoming Governance review of YUSU.</p>
<p>In the past month Khatu had successfully negiotated a Sky TV Package for the JCR as well use of the Roger Kirk Centre as an events venue for the college.</p>
<p>YUSU President Anne-Marie Canning said: &quot;The JCRC have conducted themselves impeccably with regards to following the constitution, a constitution passed by James College students.&quot;</p>
<p>She added: &quot;I believe James College have had a difficult year but I have absolute faith that the team of three vice chairs will prove to be very successful in leading the college activities.&quot;</p>

<p>He always encouraged people to run for positions and sign up for anything.</p>
<p>Chet was always brilliant in Senate and would always do the best thing for his college and this university!</p>
<p>He has ample time for anyone that ever needed him and did so much work behind the scenes that no one ever saw!</p>
<p>James JCRC are really stupid for no confidencing him,</p>
<p>Chet always tried his hardest and fought for everyone and every issue in the college, and you will regret the decission!</p>
<p>Chet I will personally miss you.. but the loss to the college and the university is far greater than my feelings!<br />
I am so sorry this had to happen in such a bad way to such a good person!</p>

<p>May I be the first to express my disgust at this ridiculously one-sided article.  As a first-year James student having lived in the college during Chet&#039;s time as chair, I can only say that the overwhelming majority of people I have spoken to find Chet both aggressive in manner and useless in action - when it comes to picking up shit from the quad before Quad Dash, for example, he&#039;s nowhere to be seen.  Oh, and as far as I can tell, &#039;the most undemocratic decision ever been made&#039; was that of Chet Khatu to secure Sky TV for the JCR, at a cost (I am told) of &pound;2000 to the University, without consulting ONE member of the college.  I for one would have wanted the money to be spent elsewhere, and I didn&rsquo;t get a say.  The majority of James students will welcome this move.</p>

<p>I agree. The article is ridiculously biased, the main quote is given by someone who is known to be good friends with Chet.I&#039;ve been to many James events including Quad dash and I saw great commitment from the committee to make it a great day apart from Chet who was sitting on his backside on a hammock drinking and smoking all day.</p>

<p>It is interesting that all the people so far supporting the no confidence motion don&#039;t have the courage to put their name next to their post!</p>
<p>As someone who has worked alot with Chet I would just like to reassure the students of James, that Chet did do everything that could be done for you. Much of this was behind the scenes, often unreported and unseen so please bear that in mind.</p>

<p>First a vote of no confidence for a Sab, then electing a pirate as a  president now removing a JCRC chair?!?</p>
<p>What is wrong with York Uni Students and the faith in the union and the way things are run!<br />
Why is the union ripping itself apart?</p>
<p>As for all the people that voted against Chet...<br />
If you thought that you could have done a better job, why didnt you step up to the plate.<br />
I really do not understand why some of these comments are so happy about removing a chair, do you not think of how it must be for him! Do you not think of reprecussions, sure you may be smug now but today is a failure for this union, for democracy and for James Students!</p>

<p>I think that although there are clearly two sides to this story it is sad to see a vote of no confidence take place in such an undemocratic manner. It should have been at a general forum for the entire college and debated with as much respect as Chet and his position deserves.<br />
As for other events grinding to a halt because of his departure, let me be the first to say that FULL STOP (hosted by Student Stop AIDS, James College and a plethora of other societies) will be the best ever and not to be missed!</p>

<p>Daniel - it is very intimidating to support this but we are doing what we believe to be the best thing for James.</p>
<p>Chet was no confidenced for a variety of reasons and for those of you involved in the running of the college you won&#039;t need any explanation. The no confidence vote was supported by the college administrator, provost, the majority of the JCRC and other people who feel let down and disappointed with Chet.</p>
<p>I can give several examples but there is no point picking it all to pieces here.</p>
<p>Joe you say &quot;the timing of the event was poor as it is a critical time for Freshers&#039; Week organisation.&quot;</p>
<p>It should be noted that Chet has not been in attendance for a single Fresher&#039;s Committee meeting this term, there have so far been 6, he has shown complete disinterest but for one event which he did not ask the committee to hold but just went off with it himself.</p>
<p>Chet was appointed chair of a committee with high ranking university officials making decisions about resources and development in the college, he failed to turn up or provide any explanation as to why. This was a huge drawback for the college as he was representing all James students and their wishes. He neither found out what our students want nor turned up to represent them. It is too late to schedule another meeting and that available fund has now been spent elsewhere without our input.</p>
<p>Chet promised to play a heavy involvement in all college events in his campaign yet appart from one event he organised himself, which caused a loss of over &pound;400, he has not helped out at all but for turning up and getting drunk whilst using his position to gain free entry with a stewards wristband.</p>
<p>Chet has not attended college council.</p>
<p>Also, at the start of the year Chet was not chair trained or RP trained, despite he enforced it that every member of the committee should attend. No member should be operating in the committee without relevant training...</p>
<p>When it comes down to it, there were several reasons why he should have been removed from post a long time ago. We have kept these quiet in an effort to maintain college cohesiveness and representation.</p>
<p>I hope that explains to some of you why this has occurred, please put yourself in the position of someone who dedicates an awful lot of their time to the college and can see that it could be managed so much more effectively. It is heartbreaking to watch when it is something you care so much about.</p>
