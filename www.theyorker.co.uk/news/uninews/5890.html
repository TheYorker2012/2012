		<div class="SubText">Elections for Vanbrugh&rsquo;s Junior Common Room Committee are here again and the Yorker gives you the low down on the candidates hoping to win your votes.</div>

        <p>The main focus is of course on the two candidates for chair, Chris West and Kallum Taylor, who both outlined their plans at the Hustings on Tuesday. Taylor promised more events, such as gaming evenings in the JCR and paintballing, and to introduce a weekly surgery and monthly newsletter. He added passionately &ldquo;if I let you down, I won&rsquo;t be able to sleep at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>West told <em><span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span></em> he wants every student &ldquo;to enjoy their time at University as much as I have.&rdquo; As a member of several Vanbrugh sports teams and someone who gets involved in &ldquo;virtually every college event&rdquo;, West believes he shows &ldquo;sheer dedication and passion for all things Vanbrugh related.&rdquo; He wishes for non-alcoholic events to be better advertised and he wants to achieve his main aim of &ldquo;maximising involvement within the college&rdquo; by creating a JCRC information board and increasing awareness of the wide range of clubs and societies available, as well as making students more aware of the welfare services.</p>
<p>To hear more from the chair candidates, tune into URY on Thursday 25th November at 6.30pm or experience the debate live in V-bar.</p>
<p>Sajni Shah and Laura Trewick are running uncontested for the two vice-chair positions and have both been involved with the JCRC last year. Sajni outlined her plans to work more with students &ldquo;to ensure their voices are heard by YUSU and a good, united college spirit is ever present&rdquo;. She promised to improve and increase the amount of non alcoholic events by working with the Red Frog team, as well as &ldquo;improve attendance at student action and RAG events through better communication and alternative advertising methods&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Trewick spoke of her desire to see Vanbrugh&rsquo;s Volume and bar events improved and to guarantee trips away to Manchester and Leeds. She argued that more student involvement in RAG and student action would lead to &ldquo;a greater sense of college spirit&rdquo;, supporting the idea of more RAG social events. Trewick finished off by outlining that she wants to &ldquo;increase awareness of welfare drop-in sessions on and off campus&rdquo; and provide better easier access to housing and finance information for students.</p>
<p>In a more contested battle for treasurer Susana Paardekooper is facing Sebastian Knight. Talking to <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span>, Paardekooper spoke of how, as treasurer she would be able to &ldquo;help make Vanbrugh even better than it already is&rdquo;. Claiming work experience has made her &ldquo;completely comfortable setting up and manipulating budgets&rdquo;, she felt her involvement with the JCRC over the past year has given her an insight into what needs to be changed. She believes regular updates are needed from the committee and she wants to better utilise funds available for volunteering, student action and non-alcoholic events.</p>
<p>Knight too stated his experience in finance and stated that &ldquo;a lot of money is being wasted&rdquo;. He wants to prioritise sports events as &ldquo;the social side brings people together and gives a community spirit&rdquo; and he would also like to see better communication with the ENTS committee ENTS event budgets. Whilst an audience member&rsquo;s question of &ldquo;how do you intend to get Britain out of the recession?&rdquo; received laughter and applause some seemed thankful that the incoming Vanbrugh treasurer won&rsquo;t have to deal with that burden.</p>
<p>Millie Newman and Feargus Hosking Jervis are running for position of secretary. Whilst Newman promised to uphold her constitutional duty and to &ldquo;represent the college at college council&rdquo; if she is elected, she also wants to work with the webmaster to update the website regularly with college news. She prides herself on her communication and organisation skills and says &ldquo;everyone will have voice in all aspects of the JCRC.&rdquo; Newman intends to help maintain committee notice boards so everyone knows what the JCRC is doing.</p>
<p>First year student Jervis spoke of his desire to &ldquo;represent first years on a predominantly second year JCRC&rdquo;. To some boos from the crowd, he put forward the case that his politics degree and will help him deal with the constitutional and bureaucratic demands of the secretary&rsquo;s role and promised that, given the opportunity, he will &ldquo;do my best to make a difference and advance the college of Vanbrugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During hustings, challenges entertained the audience, who had turned up in large numbers, as candidates were asked to prove their commitment to Vanbrugh. RAG candidates competed to collect the most money, Welfare candidates had to round up students to take Chlamydia tests, Sports candidates competed to see who could do the most press-ups in one minute and in one of the more bizarre moments of the evening, the vice-chair candidates lip-synced and danced to a song for one minute.</p>
<p>Voting is open from Thursday 12noon Week 7 until Thursday 12noon Week 8. Vote online at http://www.yusu.org/election/voting. Voting for accommodation reps must be done through a separate form available at http://www.vanbrugh-college.co.uk. The results will be announced at Vanbrugh&rsquo;s event &#039;Volume Presents...All I want for Christmas is...&#039; on Friday Week 8.</p>
