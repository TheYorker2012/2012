				Prof.Mark Hallett			</div>
				<div class="Date">Saturday, 5th March 2011</div>
		<div class="Author">
			<a href="../archive/reporter/493/index.html">Isobel Cowper-Coles</a><br />
		</div>
		<div class="SubText">Anger has been expressed by some students over the module sign-ups that took place this academic year in the History of Art department. They said that the queuing up system was unfair due to the fact that some students were served before the time stated on the email, and they were dissatisfied over the range of module choices available. </div>

        <p>Head of Department Professor Mark Hallett and Deputy Head Dr Amanda Lillie met with <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span> to discuss the issue. Professor Hallett immediately stated his desire for open and friendly debate over issues that students feel strongly about, and was happy to talk about module choices within the department, something which has left some students feeling very let down.</p>
<p>In response to the complaint that while students were told to start queuing up at 2.00pm, students who queued up before were given the first choice of modules, he said that this was &quot;simply not true&quot;, and that &quot;no-one started filling in forms until well after 2.00pm.&quot; The reason that combined course students were able to send in their choices by email was because they had a lecture at the time of signing up.</p>
<p>Professor Hallett also justified the number of modules available, saying that they still had some modules to which only two or three people were signed up to. He also pointed out that second and third year modules used to be taught together, meaning that there were fewer modules choices and that teaching was in larger groups. The choice of modules has actually increased to nine per term for each student, which allows small teaching groups and so more productive learning.</p>
<p>Both members of staff agreed that this new system, which allows students to take a part in choosing their own modules is an improvement on the old system where signing up using forms meant that it was the Chair of the Board of studies who ultimately chose which students were allowed to take which module. Under the new system the department has had fewer complaints and attempts to change modules during the term. Inevitably, there are always going to be a few students who do not get the module they want, as numbers have to be capped to make sure that teaching groups are not too large. Second year course rep Samia Calbayrac told <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span> that students were happy with the staff response to the issue, as they held an emergency meeting to identify problems and resolve them.</p>
<p>With the rise in tuition fees being imminent, students are also concerned with the amount of contact time they have currently, and whether this would increase under the new fees. Professor Hallett told <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span> that a new modular course had begun at the start of this academic year which already includes more contact hours. However, the emphasis in humanities subject was on independent study and research. He also pointed out that field work is often not included in contact hours, and that students should make full use of tutorials and supervisor meetings to increase their contact time.</p>
<p>One possible option for a different sign-up system would be to do it online; however, this has its own disadvantages, and would need the university to implement it. The advantages of the current system is that it is flexible, in that if a module is full, students can immediately see all the other spaces available. It is done in the presence of staff and administrators so that any queries can be directly addressed and solved. It also means that students have direct control over their course, as with the previous system it was staff who ultimately determined places, especially where second and third preferences were concerned. Students also know immediately what their course will be for that term.</p>
<p>Both members of staff emphasised the importance of one&rsquo;s supervisor and the department administrator being the first port of call for any complaints or problems they may have, and that they are willing to engage in meaningful debate over any issues that students may feel strongly about.</p>

<p>bollocks.  I still don&#039;t understand why EVERY OTHER DEPARTMENT manages to have a form-based module sign up that works just fine and we have to queue.  And how exactly is the current system more flexible than listing your preferences over email?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it doesn&#039;t &quot;work just fine&quot; - in English, for example, a computer allocates you based on your top three choices, no matter if you handed in the form an hour or a month before deadlines. Hence, some person who randomly thought &quot;oh, this module looks cool I guess&quot; and jots it down may well get it while someone who had their eye on it for ages because they want to follow that subject with an MA or something, may not get it.</p>
