		<div class="SubText">To kick off this year&#039;s Know Your Sabb articles, The Yorker interviews the candidates for Welfare Officer - Jenny Coyle, Ben Humphrys and Matthew Pallas.</div>

        
<ul><li><strong>Relevant experience?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Jenny Coyle:</strong> I created a society concerning the use of sun beds and the harm they cause, providing students with alternative methods in which to tan. For this society I managed to gain sponsorship from two multi-national companies (L&rsquo;Oreal and St Tropez), and so proving that I am capable at gaining sponsorship for welfare events. The money raised from this society is then donated to Skin Cancer Research UK. I am also a member of Vanbrugh JCRC, which I have found a fulfilling experience and which has helped build my team work, communication and organisational skills.</p>
<p><strong>Ben Humphrys:</strong> Lots. Halifax welfare, YUSU Welfare Committee, HCSA Freshers&#039; Committee 2008, Union Council and former trustee, LGBT Officer and LGBT Committee, presenter of the URY Welfare Show, various society positions and break up advisor for many many relationships...</p>
<p><strong>Mathew Pallas:</strong> I&rsquo;ve done loads of things in my four years here at York, but the two that are most relevant are my roles as YUSU LGBT Officer and as Langwith Welfare Rep. Being a college welfare rep means being on the &ldquo;front lines&rdquo; of welfare provision. It involves a lot of 1 to 1 contact with students, and really helps give an understanding of what students&rsquo; concerns are. Both roles also gave me an insight into how YUSU and the welfare system work, where there are problems, and where there are opportunities to take things forward.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Why are you running?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> I am running for the position of welfare because I am passionate about how students experience university life, and making sure that their safety and well-being is of a high priority. Although my past welfare experience may be limited I think this could become a positive, as I will be able to gain a different perspective which students may find extremely helpful.</p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> Because I want to see fewer bad things and more good things. Bad things like friends suffering from depression, people being screwed over by their landlords, students feeling unable to come to us when they need help, students dropping out because of <em>that</em> time, or from being estranged from their parents, or just not finding their course as easy as they&rsquo;d hoped. Good things like students dusting themselves off and picking themselves up, students enjoying uni and finding the housing move at the end of the year smooth sailing rather than a huge ball of stress, students getting the most out of uni life. It&#039;s simple.</p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> I think welfare is a very interesting job, but it&rsquo;s also a very important one &ndash; particularly this year as the role of Academic &amp; Welfare officer has been split into Academic Affairs Officer and Welfare Officer, meaning there is a real opportunity to take the role forward and develop welfare provision in a way we haven&rsquo;t been able to do before. I think the experience I can bring to the role will really help us make the most of this opportunity.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Why should students vote for you?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> I believe that students should vote for me because I&rsquo;ve lived my university life to the maximum, and I think that this provides experience which is invaluable. I want to make welfare campaigns less patronising to students so that they can connect with them more, and also make them far more accessible by showing students exactly what is available to them.</p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> Because I&rsquo;m experienced; because I&rsquo;ve actually dealt with students facing some of the most terrible problems they could face. Because I&rsquo;m committed to this union, as I&rsquo;ve shown week in week out as LGBT officer, because I&rsquo;ve seen where what we do is good and, more importantly, where what we do is bad and I want to fix it. Maybe most importantly though, because I&rsquo;m aware that we in the welfare team often fail to reach many, even the majority, of students, and because that is the single greatest failing a union welfare service could have, a failing that I will tackle.</p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> I&rsquo;ve experienced welfare from both the YUSU side and the college side, so I&rsquo;ve got a very clear understanding of how everything works, and where there&rsquo;s room for improvement. There&rsquo;s a real need for more joined-up thinking in welfare provision - properly thought through strategies on issues like alcohol and sexual health, and better communication between student and university welfare providers. Also, my policies are things that will have an impact on all students &ndash; not just freshers and future entrants to the university. The work I plan to do on the Housing Code of Best Practice will affect all students living off campus next year, while my plans to improve the careers service are particularly important to students during the current economic climate.</p>

<ul><li><strong>The best thing I&#039;ve done at uni is...</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> Starting Tanning Soc. When my friend Martin and I told everyone the idea we had, everyone laughed at us and said there is no way anyone would join. At the stall at Freshers&#039; Fair we were inundated with people wanting to join, and I would have to say that the society being a success and raising money for charity is one of the best things I have ever done at university.</p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> The Love Without Borders campaign. It&#039;s been a nightmare; in fact it&rsquo;s not even over yet. Three weeks of stress and more coffee than is healthy, but it&#039;s been completely worth it. We&rsquo;ve reached students who&rsquo;ve never been involved before, we&rsquo;ve been able to give support to people who would never have had it otherwise and we even managed to raise &pound;1300 auctioning off everything from the Student Development and Charities officer to Sir Ian McKellan&rsquo;s jumper!!</p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> Definitely YSIS. I&rsquo;m volunteering at St George&rsquo;s Primary in Fulford at the moment, working with kids around age eight. They&rsquo;re really great at that age &ndash; so enthusiastic about everything! I&rsquo;d recommend YSIS to anyone.  When I finish at York I&rsquo;m planning to do a PGCE and go on to become a primary school teacher.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Guilty Pleasure?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> I would probably have to say spending too many Wednesday nights in Ziggy&#039;s...</p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> Vanbrugh cakes....</p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> Baking. Whenever I&rsquo;m stressed out with work and essay deadlines, I cheer myself up by making a cake. Not exactly healthy eating, but it does make me popular with my housemates. Chocolate cake and banana cake are probably my favourites.</p>
<p><strong>QUICK FIRE</strong></p>

<ul><li><strong>Duck or goose?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> Duck</p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> Duck, Trevor the (R.I.P.)</p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> Duck. I really miss Trevor!!!</p>

<ul><li><strong>Tru or Gallery?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> Gallery</p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> Troffs on a Sunday</p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> Sunday Troffs</p>

<ul><li><strong>Night or day?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> Night</p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> Both normally.</p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> Night</p>

<ul><li><strong>Coffee or tea?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> Tea</p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> Coffee... see above</p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> Tea!!! (Yorkshire Tea or Earl Grey, depending on my mood.)</p>

<ul><li><strong>Brown or Cameron?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> Neither</p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> Neither, they&rsquo;re not my type.</p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> Brown. Although I would like to see someone like Jon Cruddas or Harriet Harman become PM one day.</p>

<p>Whilst remaining totally impartial to the actual welfare contest, #3 reflects the sad attitude that I think is becoming increasingly prominent, although perhaps  only exaggerated because of the up-coming elections. That a student has essentially wasted their university life simply because they haven&#039;t started more than 1 society and have failed to participate in student politics. Personally, whilst each to their own, I found my brief stint in student politics, albeit a jcr, far less fulfilling than my degree, university sport and socializing with my friends. Big deal #3!!! you handed out tickets for a college event every two weeks and sit through hours of monotonous meetings, you are clearly a model student that all others should strive to be x</p>

<p>Yes #5, for some people, University life isnt all about clubs and societies and student politics, but those people probably shouldn&#039;t be running for a sabb position. Of course you&#039;d expect anyone wanting to be the person in charge of college welfare to have some welfare experience, be it in a society, jcrc or yusu.</p>
<p>University life is far more fulfilling if you take advantage of the opportunities available to you. In your post, you said you found sport something you wanted to do - so you did get involved. We all care about different things, and those are the things we should get involved in. My issue with Jenny is that she apparently never bothered about these things in the past.</p>

<p>ahh, but again whilst reiterating that i&#039;m am by no means supporting jenny coyle, your reference to her seems a little unfair. After all, apparently she has been a jcr member and captained a university sports team, and as I tried to stress before, both me and you know little else of her student background, which doesn&#039;t mean that part of her life hasn&#039;t been important. IF she is she is enthusiastic, and capable it makes little difference whether her previous experience was running a sports team or being involved in student politics.</p>
<p>I think we all forget, the difficulties of the yusu positions are incredibly over-exaggerated, the vast majority of students would be perfectly capable of doing the job if they had any inclination to use it as a means to further their career, which the majority, whatever their protestations, do it for. Indeed, I think we can all attest to the complete &#039;anarchy&#039; the university has fallen into under tom scott.....</p>

<p>I don&#039;t think anyone will attest to any form of &quot;anarchy&quot; in any respect of the word. That&#039;s a stupid point.</p>
<p>I am curious as to the response to #3&#039;s point... Whilst I agree that living life to the full doesn&#039;t mean you have to start a ton of societies, I haven&#039;t seen much of what Jenny Coyle means by that quote. Going to bars every night, playing university sports or volunteering in Africa?</p>
<p>That&#039;s not a point in favour or against any candidate, just a question on this topic. To clarify.</p>
<p>And I guess we&#039;ll find out tonight either way...!</p>

<ul id="CommentItem6054History" class="comment_edit"><li>Wed, 4th Mar 2009 6:02pm - Edited by the author</li></ul><p>I agree with #7.</p>
<p>While I do believe strongly that we need to be encouraging participation, I think that electing someone who has no experience whatsoever to run and coordinate YUSU&#039;s most important and sensitive service is something that I am not really keen to see.</p>
<p>No offense to Jenny, I am sure she is a nice person, but if she really cared so much about student welfare then she should have tried to get involved earlier on. And setting up a tanning society promoting safe tanning is hardly what I&#039;d call relevant experience for that job. So, let us not be so quick to discredit relevant knowledge and previous involvement, as it is almost a commonsensical prerequisite for someone to get a paid full time job. Especially when we are talking about what is arguably the most sensitive and challenging job within YUSU.</p>
<p>Let me also point out that I am not supporting another candidate for this position, so this is by no means promoting anyone.</p>

<p>While experience is always a plus, I don&#039;t believe it is everything. YUSU officers go through loads of training and work extremely closely with a fantastic member of staff, who co-ordinates the academic and welfare service and will offer plenty of valuable guidance to whomever wins.</p>
<p>The training and support I mention means that other characteristics, skills, and experience can be just as important. I do not know Jenny but she is obviously popular within her college, the teams she is a member of, and the societies with which she is involved. This would suggest that she is a reasonably approachable person - a key skill in a welfare officer. She is also obviously extremely passionate about the role.</p>
<p>Welfare experience, as I say, is always useful, but I do not believe it is the be-all-and-end-all; the job will provide a steep learning curve for whomever is elected.</p>
<p>I also think some of the comments on here have been quite spiteful and fail to see why. If you are not convinced by a candidate then don&#039;t vote for them; posting anonymous, cheap digs at candidates and the causes they care about is really low.</p>

<p>#10, I don&#039;t think you understand that officers gain training once in office.  I am a Vanbrugh Welfare Rep and before I gained this position I don&#039;t think my past experience as an Ents Rep, sports team member or society treasurer helped me to be more competent when holding drop-in sessions or welfare related meetings, but I got trained. And, if she wins, Jenny will too!</p>
<p>If a student wasn&#039;t capable of being a welfare officer without having experience of being a JCRC welfare rep then YUSU should change the system so that you cannot run without that experience.  Fortunately that is not the case, so listen to Dan and just don&#039;t vote rather than post anonymous, cheap digs.  If you&#039;re too embarrassed to put your name to what you&#039;re saying, maybe it should not be said at all.<br />
Please note; I am supporting Jenny Coyle but this post is from the view of me as a College Welfare Rep rather than a campaigner.</p>

<p>I think that the issue with most people is that the other two have serious welfare background including both being welfare Officers (LGBT is very strongly linked to welfare) and have had years of experience in talking to people in need of help. This is obviously an advantage but I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve seen anyone say it&#039;s a necessity.</p>
<p>I&#039;m still waiting for Jenny to answer my previous question though: what do you consider &quot;making the most of University&quot; to mean? Is it drinking, going to college events, playing sports, travelling, Student Action, student politics, protesting against the government...?</p>

<p>#13 is absolutely spot on in my opinion. Coyle&#039;s manifesto and speech at hustings yesterday clearly shows someone who is passionate and committed to the welfare of students at York. Of course previous experience should be taken into account however, every time I have encountered Coyle I have found her to be a very personable, friendly and down to earth person and surely these qualities are the most important aspects of being welfare officer. In my opinion people should stop targeting Jenny Coyle and give her some credit for having the courage to stand up for something she believes in and is passionate about.</p>

<p>When considering the three candidates for Welfare Officer, I don&#039;t think the issue is that Jenny lacks the passion, approachability or empathy to do the job. At least it shouldn&#039;t be.</p>
<p>Instead, I think it is more that Ben and Matt both have a proven track record of welfare experience at JCRC and YUSU level, as both have been college Welfare Reps and both have been the YUSU LGBT Officer. In fairness to Ben, despite Matt&#039;s proclaimation at Hustings that he is &quot;the most experienced candidate&quot;, I think both have equal experience. Hence, I think it&#039;s fair to say that they are regarded as the &#039;safe&#039; bets, whilst Jenny is more of an unknown quantity.</p>
<p>Moreover, as has been said previously in this thread, whilst experience is not the essential requirement, it is important. This is because it means that you are better equipped to deal with the problems that students will come to you with, even before you&#039;ve received the welfare training.</p>
<p>It is vitally important that the right candidate is elected for such a position as Welfare Officer, and I appeal to everyone that they inform themselves enough about all three candidates before casting their votes.</p>

<p>I&#039;d just like to make it clear, in case #18 was partly directed at me, that I am not supporting any specific candidate. I was just seeking clarification on her comment, which she is yet to provide!</p>
<p>Passion, approachability, knowledge(including policies and implementation thereof) and experience are the most important factors for this position and each candidate has a different level of each trait. As with all of the contested Sabb positions, it&#039;ll be interesting to see how things end up!</p>
