		<div class="SubText">After hustings on Thursday, this year&rsquo;s YUSU elections have officially hit the ground running. The Yorker caught up with the Presidential candidates over the weekend, asking them the usual (and a few not so usual) questions, giving you a better taste of what they&rsquo;re all about. 
</div>

        <p>We spoke to Aaron Rolph (AR), Charlie Rowley (CR), Lydia Blundell (LB) and Tim Ellis (TE). This is what they had to say.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Why have you decided to run?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> I have decided to run because I feel York has such potential as an all round institution, yet very little of this potential is realised outside of academia. Many aspects of campus must be improved and after 2 1/2 years of frustration, I would like the opportunity to oversee the development and improvement of YUSU and the University.</p>
<p><strong>CR:</strong> I really feel I am the most passionate candidate and committed to making a difference and can represent every student across the university. After 2 &frac12; years of being involved in my college, different societies and across campus, many students and friends all encouraged me to run because they really believe I could do a good job and can represent students to the best of my ability.</p>
<p><strong>LB:</strong> I want to make sure every students voice is heard; YUSU needs to represent everyone, and when I was Halifax President I didn&#039;t think YUSU had enough outreach, so now I want to change that!</p>
<p><strong>TE:</strong> I decided to run simply because I believe I have the commitment, enthusiasm, and dedication that a YUSU President needs.</p>

<ul><li><strong>What makes you better than the rest?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> Having not been biased by previous experience in YUSU politics, I strive to offer an entirely fresh perspective, as an ordinary student who has taken part in as wider variety of activities as possible during my time in York.</p>
<p><strong>CR:</strong> My communication, passion, desire and drive for the job and to get things done to really put students at the heart of their union. By the end of the year I really would have hoped to change opinion about what a union can do.</p>
<p><strong>LB</strong>: I&#039;m the only candidate who will listen to and give a voice to as many students as possible. And I will fight to make sure their opinions get voiced.</p>
<p><strong>TE:</strong> I believe that I&rsquo;m better than the rest as I&rsquo;m approachable and easy to talk to but professional and determined. The University has some big decisions to make over the next year and YUSU needs to keep the pressure up on them to not let students down. I believe I am the best candidate to make sure students&rsquo; views are heard.</p>

<ul><li><strong>How do you plan on making YUSU more accessible to the general student body?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> My main policy focus aims to connect YUSU with you, the students. I aim to build a mobile union that can be felt across the entirety of campus, running workshops for feedback, and spending time working in &#039;public&#039; domain. I will also review communication policies involving more use of interactive blogs using Youtube, and simplifying the web design to make the site easier to use.</p>
<p><strong>CR:</strong> Being visible, and being out around campus amongst students. I would also hold open meetings in JCRs and regular meetings with JCRC committees to make sure we are dealing with real issues students are facing. I&rsquo;d also like to publicise a sabbatical/ Presidents question time so you can ask direct questions about any area of the union and hold that officer to account.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to re-establish a good relationship with the media who do provide information about what the union is doing to students.</p>
<p><strong>LB:</strong> Talking is the key way to get students opinions! YUSU had staff members that can be utilised to gain feeback, and a new student centre is in the planning - I want to make Sabbs more accessible through this, and more regular updates through the website.</p>
<p><strong>TE:</strong> My manifesto is based on making YUSU more representational and to increase participation. I want to do this by increasing communication down to JCRCs and making sure students are being consulted more often, and made more aware of issues that are being voted on by their delegates.</p>

<ul><li><strong>How do you plan on integrating Heslington East with the main campus, so that students have a sense of unity as a University, instead of being divided?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> I have pledged to spend at least one day per week on Heslington East to help include the students there into YUSU and &#039;Hes West&#039;. The feedback workshops I intend to run will also operate on Hes East and I will also attend JCRC meetings where possible to help advise and support students.</p>
<p><strong>CR:</strong> Hes East saw some great events which were attended by the wider student population, such as Goodfest in the summer and as YUSU president would like more events on Hes East to integrate the two campuses. I would also look into the possibility, when Hes East is near completion arranging sports events and others between the two campuses to increase the college spirit and introduce campus competition.</p>
<p><strong>LB:</strong> I think this will happen naturally as Hes East develops, but I want to make sure the students here and now are heard! It&#039;s important that campaigns happening on main campus are integrated over there, as well as adequate welfare provision to make sure students don&#039;t feel isolated.</p>
<p><strong>TE:</strong> Having lived on Hes East since October, I&rsquo;ve seen firsthand how easy it is for students to feel disconnected from main campus. I think one of the main ways of integrating both campuses is simply by making sure Goodricke students are aware of campaigns and services on Hes West, and that we are encouraging societies and YUSU officers to actually go over there as much as possible.</p>

<ul><li><strong>What can we expect from your campaign over the next two weeks?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> BRIGHT, exciting colours- Neon Pink and Yellow. Dot-to-dot on campus, and many other tricks but it is early days yet ;)</p>
<p><strong>CR:</strong> Over the next two weeks I hope you will easily be able to see me and my team out in colleges and around campus consulting students on what it is they actually want from their Union President. High Vis jackets and Hard Hats at the ready!!</p>
<p><strong>LB:</strong> I&#039;m trying to get as many students involved as possible, as I&#039;ve made clear in my policies and manifesto that their voices need to be heard. You&#039;ll see me around campus with my &quot;ideas box&quot; and &quot;thought pad&quot; - allowing students to interact and voice their concerns/suggestions for YUSU.</p>
<p><strong>TE:</strong> I&rsquo;m currently working on some huge banners and posters will be going up today all over campus. More importantly though, I want to talk to as many people as possible, both to explain my policies but to listen and see what their concerns are.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Your best and worst qualities in two words:</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> Enthusiasm; stubbornness.</p>
<p><strong>CR:</strong> Best = Great Communicator. Worst = Karaoke lover.</p>
<p><strong>LB:</strong> Best: Listening, Worst: Eating too much chocolate!</p>
<p><strong>TE:</strong> Best: Commitment. Worst: Sometimes I take on too much responsibility.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Favourite movie quote:</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> &ldquo;Spartans! Ready your breakfast and eat hearty... For tonight, we dine in hell!&rdquo; &ndash; 300.</p>
<p><strong>CR:</strong> &ldquo;Some men are born great, others achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them.&rdquo; Shakespeare/ Kings Speech.</p>
<p><strong>LB:</strong> &quot;To Infinity and Beyond&quot;!!</p>
<p><strong>TE:</strong> &ldquo;Shoot Her!&rdquo; &ndash; Muldoon from Jurassic Park</p>

<ul><li><strong>If your Presidential Campaign were a song, what would it be?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> &quot;Yesterday&quot; by the Beatles. No just kidding, probably &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; by Europe - Epic.</p>
<p><strong>CR:</strong> &quot;Start of Something New!&rdquo; &ndash; High School musical.</p>
<p><strong>LB:</strong> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYyzBbWPV5w">S.O.U.L. &quot;Express Yourself&quot;</a></p>
<p><strong>TE:</strong> Rick Astley &ndash; &ldquo;Never Gonna Give Up&rdquo;</p>

<ul><li><strong>If you were a superhero, what would your power be and how would you use it in your role as YUSU President? What would you be called?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> Either <strong>Action Man</strong>, because I am very practically minded and will get things done OR <strong>Invisiman</strong> ensuring all University politics is transparent. (Eurgh cringe).</p>
<p><strong>CR:</strong> I&rsquo;d love the ability to fly! That way i&rsquo;d be able to cut down on time walking from different places and can meet more people to talk to and get a lot more things done.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;ROWLEY TO THE RESCUE!&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>LB:</strong> <strong>Jedi Mind Trick</strong> - So Senior Management would instantly do as I say!</p>
<p><strong>TE:</strong> Power &ndash; Time Travel, to prove that my policies will come true. Name &ndash; <strong>YUSUperman</strong> (that took ages to come up with).</p>

<ul><li><strong>If you were a member of the opposite sex, what would you wear on a night out?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> A tasteful but bold dress thats sexy, but not too short.</p>
<p><strong>CR:</strong> Probably a jacket and a nice dress. High-heeled shoes and Bridget Jones style undies! That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I have thought about this way too much&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>LB:</strong> Jeans and a shirt - guys have it easy!</p>
<p><strong>TE:</strong> Not much.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Tagline:</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> Connect YUSU, connect the dots: vote for Rolph.</p>
