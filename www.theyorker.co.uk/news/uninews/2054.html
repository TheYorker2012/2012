<h3> Autumn Term </h3>


<ul><li><strong>Missing student found drowned</strong>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<div style="float: right; width: 180px; padding: 2px"><a href="../../photos/full/808.jpg"><img src="../../photos/medium/808.jpg" width="180" height="145" title="Rob Davies" alt="Rob Davies"  /></a><div>Rob Davies</div></div>
<p></p>
<p>On Monday 1st October, eight days after he had gone pmissing, the search for 20-year-old York Chemistry student Rob Davies reached a tragic end - a body believed to be his was recovered by police from the River Ouse.</p>
<p>CCTV footage had shown Rob outside Ziggy&rsquo;s nightclub at 12.38am on Sunday 23rd January, but he had not been seen since. A massive search, including a Facebook campaign set up by some of Rob&rsquo;s closest friends, had attracted overwhelming support.</p>
<p>It was later announced that a tree was to be planted in Rob&rsquo;s memory in the grounds of the chemistry department. The ceremony, held on 10th January 2008, was organised by Rob&#039;s friends, alongside chemistry professors.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Freshers faced consequences of building complications</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>At the start of the academic year, more than a hundred freshers faced not moving into their college rooms after contractors failed to finish building them.</p>
<p>Contractors failed to finish construction at the Bleachfields site off University Road, which was to house incoming Vanbrugh students.The disruption shifted 47 Langwith first years to the Holiday Inn near York Racecourse, almost four miles from campus.</p>
<p>The disruption meant that first years could not move in until mid-November and building work on another two blocks went on until early 2008. Officials blamed last summer&#039;s wet weather for &quot;severe delays&quot;.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Heslington East blueprints revealed</strong>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<div style="float: right; width: 180px; padding: 2px"><a href="../../photos/full/580.jpg"><img src="../../photos/medium/580.jpg" width="180" height="145" title="Heslington East Blueprint" alt="Heslington East Blueprint"  /></a><div>Heslington East</div></div>
<p></p>
<p>The architects for Heslington East released the blueprint for the first phase of the development, to be submitted to the city council early in 2008.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the university said: &quot;The idea is to mirror the existing campus - to create a campus with a similar atmosphere.&quot;</p>

<ul><li><strong>YUSU announced closure of Your:Books</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>It was announced that Your:Books, the second-hand book shop on campus, was to close at the end of the spring term. The service had lost many customers in recent years as online book services had become increasingly popular.
Your:Books had been serving students for over 20 years.</p>

<ul><li><strong>American cults targeted York students</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>The American cults &lsquo;Children of God&rsquo; and &lsquo;International Church of Christ&rsquo; targeted York students on campus. Reports were released on York Extra which revealed that students had been approached by members of the religious organisations.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Intruder alert raised old security concerns</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>In November, old concerns about college security resurfaced when several students raised the alarm about an unknown man prying around campus after he got into a Derwent kitchen.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Deadly virus hit campus rabbits</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>An outbreak of a lethal disease myxomatosis struck rabbits on campus. Highly contagious, the disease resulted in a number of fatalities.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Gallery grabbed top nightclub in York accolade</strong>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<div style="float: right; width: 180px; padding: 2px"><a href="../../photos/full/804.jpg"><img src="../../photos/medium/804.jpg" width="180" height="145" title="The Gallery" alt="The Gallery"  /></a><div>The Gallery: Top nightspot</div></div>
<p></p>
<p>In November, The Gallery Nightclub won the accolade of York&rsquo;s top nightspot in the Best Bar None awards, taking the prize away from 2006 winners Nexus.
The Old White Swan on Goodramgate was awarded &lsquo;Best Pub&rsquo; while Orgasmic on Coney Street, was awarded the title of &lsquo;Best Bar&rsquo;.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Vanbrugh football team went naked for charity calendar</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>In November, the Vanbrugh College football team got naked together and ran across the astroturf for the shoot of their naked calendar.
The proceeds from the sale of the calendars were donated to Cancer Research UK, in the hope that the project would raise awareness for testicular cancer.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Langwith students staged 24-hour sit-in</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>Langwith students held a 24-hour sit-in protest on Friday 23rd November to campaign for the restoration of 24-hour portering to the college.</p>

<ul><li><strong>JJ&#039;s faced closure</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>In November, the Halifax College bar, JJ&rsquo;s, first faced its potential closure after a drop in custom over recent months. A Facebook group entitled &lsquo;JJ&#039;s &ndash; use it or lose it&rsquo; was created by Halifax students in an attempt to raise awareness and save the bar.</p>
<p>During early 2008 it has was decided that the bar would remain open, at least until the end of this academic year, however, JJ&rsquo;s hosted its last event in Week 8, a &#039;Good Buy Weekend&#039;, before its final closure.</p>
<p>The closure has faced criticism, as it leaves Halifax freshers without a bar for the start of the next academic year, and may create difficulties for new students due to the isolation of Halifax from the main campus.</p>

<ul><li><strong>York university topped national media awards</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>York swept the board at the Guardian Student Media Awards in November, grabbing 7 of 13 awards. Imperial College&#039;s two made them the only other university to win more than one award.</p>
<p>The results represented a return to form for the reputable York media, which failed to bag a single award in 2006.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Shock after student commits suicide</strong>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<div style="float: right; width: 180px; padding: 2px"><a href="../../photos/full/946.jpg"><img src="../../photos/medium/946.jpg" width="180" height="145" title="Laura Gerstel" alt="Laura Gerstel"  /></a><div>Laura Gerstel</div></div>
<p></p>
<p>On 27th November, the university was in shock after a third year Vanbrugh student was found dead in the early hours of the morning at a house in Fulford Road. The body was later identified as 20-year-old biochemist Laura Gerstel.</p>
<p>Police later announced there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding her death and adjourned their inquest.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Student conman caught and sentenced</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>On 26th November a conman who successfully scammed York students was sentenced to 12 months in prison. Mark Raymond Brown, who conned students into giving him money for a train ticket home by saying his car had broken down, pleaded guilty to 8 counts of deception. He told his victims he would return the money by arranging to meet them the following day, failing to turn up and leaving a fake mobile number.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Library system criticised after student is fined &pound;700</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>In December, the university faced criticism over its library fines policy after a student received bills totalling &pound;700 for books she said were loaned properly.</p>
<p>Rhianne Jones argued the fine was an administrative mistake and managed to negotiate the fee down to just &pound;32.60, but still felt victimised.</p>


<h3> Spring Term </h3>


<ul><li><strong>Campus newspapers faced uncertain furture</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>In January, it was discovered that award-winning student newspapers Nouse and York Vision faced an uncertain future after their printing costs tripled overnight.</p>
<p>Local business Newsquest ended a decades-old agreement to print the papers at cost price, after finding itself in financial difficulties.
However, funds from YUSU managed to secure the future of the papers for the immediate future.</p>

<ul><li><strong>FTR bus fares increased</strong>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<div style="float: right; width: 180px; padding: 2px"><a href="../../photos/full/1052.jpg"><img src="../../photos/medium/1052.jpg" width="180" height="145" title="Ftr" alt="Ftr"  /></a><div>FTR rise in fares</div></div>
<p></p>
<p>In early January, York students were angered when they faced a 20% price rise on FTR buses. First York raised prices on the number 4 route from the university to York city centre to &pound;1.80 for a single and &pound;2.90 for a return journey.</p>
<p>A Facebook group, &#039;FTR....FIGHT THE RISE&#039; was set up, and a boycott of the buses was planned, but both had limited success as many students still used the service. There have been ongoing discussions with First since, resulting in trials of lower fares.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Lecturer criticised for losing radioactive chemical</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>A senior lecturer was criticised in a report released by the university for playing a part in losing a radioactive chemical. The report concerned the radium, which was eventually found in a scrapyard in early 2007.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Welfare Officer removed after hitting student</strong>

<p>In early January, YUSU Academic and Welfare Officer Grace Fletcher-Hackwood admitted hit second year Dan Taylor in the head in a drunken argument outside campus event <em>Chav D</em>. Fletcher-Hackwood later faced a no-confidence motion submitted by Taylor.</p>
<p>On 31st January at the UGM, YUSU Student Development and Charities Officer Joey Ellis used the meeting as a platform to speak out against her colleague. Ellis, who said she was &quot;too emotional&quot; to read her statement, passed her speech on to Anne-Marie Canning, UGM Chair, to read. It said: &quot;Violence, no matter how small the action or chance of physical harm is unacceptable in my eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>On Thursday 7th February, Fletcher-Hackwood was voted out of her position as Academic and Welfare Officer by only 8 votes. 1440 votes were cast, an unprecedented total for a UGM vote, passing the motion by just a 0.5% majority. Fletcher-Hackwood left her post with immediate effect, leaving YUSU without a welfare representative for the remainder of the academic year.</p>
