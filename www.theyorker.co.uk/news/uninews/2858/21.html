		<div class="SubText">The Yorker reported live from The Courtyard, bringing you the latest news as it came in. We voiced your views, we spoke to candidates and current officers and had fun throughout the night. We hope you enjoyed it too!</div>

        <p><em>Additional reporting from Chris Travis, Antonia Moura, Rachel Basch, Chloe Dean, Claire Curtis and Laura Lennkh.</em></p>
<p><strong>Check back over the next few days for further coverage and comments.</strong></p>
<p><strong>01:51</strong> According to Tom Scott our elections have seen the highest turnout of all the universities in the country. Although 23% isn&#039;t exactly impressive.</p>
<p>As the night draws to a close we can&#039;t help but note the amount of discontent amongst students, who said apathy is dead?</p>
<p><strong>01:50</strong> Our new YUSU President Elect Tim Ngwena says: &quot;I feel very good, I feel relieved, very relieved. It&#039;s been months of hard work.&quot;</p>
<p>Reflecting on the year ahead Ngwena voices positive views: &quot;I think the team is great, they represent the students and even though it was very close in certain cases, it just goes to show the calibre of the candidates.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>01:47</strong> Former YUSU presidential candidate Bushby told <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>: &quot;I think we&#039;re going to have another year of uneffectual [sic] leadership. Tom deserved to win tonight. I&#039;m disappointed with tonight&#039;s results. I don&#039;t think we are gonna see the development, improvement and growth of York University that we deserved. I&#039;m glad I&#039;m graduating this year.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>01:44</strong> Former YUSU Ac&amp;Welf Officer, Grace Fletcher-Hackwood told us: &quot;I&#039;m disappointed two of my good friends lost. I find it disappointing personally. Langrish worked really hard over a long period.&quot; She has stressed that she thinks &quot;the union will be in safe hands.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>01:39</strong> &quot;Student fucking politics is dead!&quot; exclaims one student.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../../photos/large/3198.jpg" alt="" /><br /></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>01:34</strong> 24% turn out...</p>

<ul><li>Grant Bradley - 177

</li><li>Charles Bushby - 226

</li><li>Tom Langrish - 118

</li><li>Tim Ngwena - 1202
</li></ul>
<p><strong>01:33</strong> The crowds roar as the names of the candidates are announced...</p>
<p>Tom Scott announces: &quot;In 3 months, someone is going to take over from me. They&#039;re going to have the worst job and the best job they will ever have.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>01:31</strong> They&#039;re playing the final countdown in L/N/028...</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>Bushby, in a drunken state, has told us &quot;Tim shouldn&#039;t win! Tim can&#039;t win! The YUSU clan needs to be broken down, we need change!&quot; Very strong words, but the exit polls suggest he won&#039;t be the man to make such a change... We&#039;ll have to wait and see though!</p>
<p><strong>01:26</strong> Lewis Bretts tells <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> reporter Claire Curtis: &quot;I&#039;m glad it&#039;s all over!&quot; He says he&#039;s &quot;really excited about it all&quot; and is &quot;very serious about all my policies, I feel I&#039;ve set realistic ones.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>01:18</strong> With only one position left the candidates, if you didn&#039;t know already, are as follows:</p>

<ul><li>Grant Bradley

</li><li>Charles Bushby

</li><li>Tom Langrish

</li><li>Tim Ngwena
</li></ul>

<p>Bretts takes the stage: &quot;Being a candidate is a bit weird. Every single person who has put a poster up: I can&#039;t tell you how much I appreciate it.

I thought it&#039;d be right down to the wire.&quot; Describing it as &quot;eighteenth months in the waiting&quot; she can&#039;t wait to &quot;focus more on sport with no more degree getting in the way!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>00:54</strong> Elected student Activities Officer (and ex-Yorkerite) Kinchin speaks to YSTV as students dance to &#039;I see you baby&#039;. The whole place is packed as we await the last two results: Democracy &amp; Services and President.</p>

<p><strong>00:36</strong> York Sport results are about to be announced. &quot;Scott, Scott, Scott!&quot; can be heard from L/N/028. Looks like a landslide for Scott...</p>
<p><strong>00:31</strong> Following vigorous interviews with YSTV, URY and Nouse we finally get a hold of our new Welfare Officer, Humphrys. &quot;I didn&#039;t expect such a big win, especially because of the quality of the other candidates.&quot; He told us he&#039;s &quot;very flattered and pleased.&quot; He seems keen to get stuck in!</p>
<p><strong>00:27</strong> With our blogging team so close to the bar (strategic positioning!) we can see The Courtyard appears to be making a killing. Burton comments that: &quot;I wouldn&#039;t say it makes so much, it&#039;s all recycled into the union. As long as everyone is having a good time that&#039;s all that matters!&quot;</p>

<p><strong>00:01</strong> HAPPY BIRTHDAY MARIE!</p>
<p>Watch out for Academic Officer and Welfare Officer results in the next few minutes!</p>
<p><strong>00:00</strong> In a move that mirrors last year&#039;s AU President mess up we saw the first round showing, incorrectly, that Moldova and Ball win had won by 2 votes, whereas the actual results showed that Vince &amp; Medley were in the lead, which became clear on the second round. What a close one!</p>
<p><strong>23:57</strong> Rumours suggest that Jenny Coyle, Welfare candidate, has no idea who has been elected so far. Watch this space for Welfare results!</p>
<p><strong>23:57</strong> Current LGBT Officer Sarah Fennell told <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>: &quot;I&#039;m really pleased with doorsafe. I think they did a fantastic job and I think the fact that something like that has happened really shows how important LGBT officers are! People wonder whether or not we&#039;re needed, and clearly we are.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>23:52</strong> Women&#039;s Officer Ellie Kuper Thomas told <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span>: &quot;Homophobia should NEVER be accepted on campus. It should be noted that that it was a woman who challenged him and a second woman who challenged him and brought doorsafe to the scene.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>23:48</strong> Two of our Yorker reporters are being interviewed by YSTV. How exciting!</p>
<p><strong>23:44</strong> A fight broke out following chants of &quot;You queer bastards!&quot; Doorsafe forced a man to the ground and threw him out the back door after a woman complained about his inappropriate comments and aggressive behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>23:03</strong> A quick chat with Chris Etheridge and Jason Rose reveals that both of them are &quot;extremely happy and feel privileged.&quot; They were apparently &quot;expecting&quot; the RON vote but were happy to &quot;win in all colleges&quot; Although extremely close in some colleges, Lanqwith seeing the voter turn out at 99 to 64.

<p>Now now everyone, Bushby may not have been the greatest ever candidate and a large part of my body and mind may still think he is a twat, but he knows how to grind and gave me a lovely kiss, so I can happily say that I am in love with Charles Bushby.</p>
<p>Tim will do a brilliant job I&#039;m sure (and I do look forward to working with him) but I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Tom will always be my president and exit polls should be scrapped before next year.</p>

<p>I&#039;m saddened and disappointed by last night&#039;s results. The fact that Kinchin was booed when giving her speech and many people seemed discontent with who the majority chose for President, shows that this election was just another popularity contest. I voted in the elections, but was sad to see that the majority voted for those who indulged in gimmickry and who are popular on campus, rather than those who had any real policies.</p>
<p>This is why there&#039;s so much apathy amongst students - because no matter how we vote, it seems like we can&#039;t really make a difference.</p>

<p>Tempted to agree with #24.</p>
<p>Kinchin won (let&#039;s face it) not because she was a better candidate than Shanks but because the people who saw her thought she was hot.</p>
<p>Ngwena hardly had to do any campaigning; that Fusion/Bad Taste/I want to make history like America clan saw him through with the number of votes he needed unlike the other 3 who, let&#039;s face it, didn&#039;t have the campus-wide popularity of &#039;Tim&#039;.</p>
<p>Saying that, Ben for Wefare and to a degree, Bretts for Services were not the &#039;popular&#039; choices so I think there&#039;s something to be said for the flip-side of the argument as well.</p>
<p>I still think YUSU will be weaker next year for having no Durkin, Langrish, Shanks or Johnson. Shit happens though.</p>

<p>#25 &quot;Ngwena hardly had to do any campaigning&quot;</p>
<p>What planet were you on? The three most visible campaigns were Bretts, Kinchin and Ngwena. Not once did any of his campaigners make a big deal out of his race, of course some people mentioned it but it quite correctly got no media attention and Tim himself was adamant that it wasn&#039;t used. If Langrish had organised an effective visible campaign then maybe he would have won. Ngwena certainly did have the campus wide popularity but maybe, just maybe, thats because he is a top bloke who doesn&#039;t let people down. He has done a fantastic job at Fusion, Bad Taste and running his own company. He has exactly the right qualifications to be a successful president.</p>
<p>Kinchin won because people saw her campaign, regardless of whether you regard it as gimmicky she got people to notice her and thats the key factor in any election.</p>
<p>It must be significant that the three most visible campaigns all won (Kinchin, Bretts, Ngwena)but none of them are complete gimmicks like Scott last year, all have got a decent set of policies and could argue for them fluently and expertly.</p>

<p>#27 absolutely spot on.</p>
<p>I was a member of Tim&#039;s campaign team and we campaigned EVERY day... not just in Vanbrugh in every college and even 22 Acres on Wednesday. We got out and talked to people and Tim told them his policies and they liked them. Tim got 1308 votes... I think that is a few more than Fusion and Bad Taste (which weren&#039;t block votes in any case).</p>
<p>Those that think he is a bad choice... you&#039;re in for a big shock as he works harder than anyone I have ever met and will bring extra creativity and transparency that the Presidential role requires.</p>

<p># 27 is spot on. As a member of Tim&#039;s campaign Tim I know that there some of us out every day postering and speaking to people. Once Fusion was over Tim got out and spoke to as many people as possible. He went out to 22 Acres on Wednesday to speak to sports teams as well. He won due to a phenomenal amount of hard work he put in</p>
<p>I have no doubt Tim will do and excellent job. He will be prepared to put in as many hours as necessary in order to succeed. Go Tim!</p>

<p>#24 - &#039;Kinchin won (let&#039;s face it) not because she was a better candidate than Shanks but because the people who saw her thought she was hot.&#039;</p>
<p>Mate, have you ever had to deal with Shanks through a society?  I&#039;m pretty sure anyone who has will have voted for Rhianna, Ella and Ron.</p>

<p>I agree. Though I didn&#039;t vote for Tim as my first choice, I think his hard work with Fusion etc. gives him the right attitude to make a good president. I did however, find that he had a lack of clear policy and personally, not specifying policy at hustings was an error- not everyone who voted was a member of someone&#039;s&#039;facebook group&#039;.</p>
<p>Don&#039;t think I&#039;m slating him though. His campaign was the most visible of all 4 and I guess that told in the end!</p>

<p>#27 &#039;If Langrish had organised an effective visible campaign then maybe he would have won&#039;</p>
<p>Now I have to agree with everyone that Tim does have the right skills and is a modest fellow and will be an effective president, but as a member of the Langrish campaign team I can happily say that the above statement does not do justice to the hard work of Langrish and his campaign team.</p>
<p>The plan for Langrish was to focus on 5 presidential promises and he is one of the few candidates who I felt had a campaign that was really about policies (a distinct nod to Bretts and Durkin here). He wanted every campaigner to talk to 7 people a day, minimum, and push the policies and win the votes. Tom was out and about himself every day and he spoke to students and tried to win votes. I realise and appreciate Tim did too, but I still fail to see the concrete and necessary plans Langrish pushed for.</p>
<p>I personally think Tom&#039;s work constituted an effective visible campaign, where a lack of banners or gimmicks is not a lack of a campaign. I say this because I saw how Tom worked and I was at Hustings and I saw the presidential debates and Langrish was simply amazing. Tim was an obvious second for me and in no way do I feel that the campus has lost out completely, but Tom Langrish would have been an amazing president and he will be sorely missed.</p>
<p>Either way I think that we have an amazingly varied sabs team and I look forward to seeing what they can actually do.</p>

<ul id="CommentItem6610History" class="comment_edit"><li>Sun, 15th Mar 2009 11:34am - Edited by the author</li></ul><p>But this is exactly the point I&#039;m trying to make - no one really reads the candidates policies, it&#039;s all about visibility and popularity!</p>
<p>To #27- I saw Kinchin&#039;s idiotic naked campaigners quite a few times on campus, but I didn&#039;t vote for her because her policies were so flimsy! You say &#039;Kinchin won because people saw her campaign&#039;. It&#039;s disappointing that people can&#039;t take the time to read policies, and instead they&#039;re swayed by the campaigns they&#039;ve seen most often on campus!</p>
<p>Conversely, although I never saw Langrish or Ngwena campaigning I voted based on their policies. I wish people wouldn&#039;t be swayed by the visibility /gimmickry of campaigns etc. How much time does it take to read someone&#039;s policies and think about who they&#039;d like to see in the YUSU office next year?</p>

<p>#33 Firstly, I was an idiotic naked campaigner and I wouldn&#039;t have done it if I didn&#039;t believe in Kinchin&#039;s policies. Rhianna needed a big campaign to overcome a year of experience and so she played upto the gimmick element, I think thats fair enough.</p>
<p>Secondly as mentioned earlier, a number of campaigners who wern&#039;t necessarily &#039;the popular vote&#039; such as Bretts or an even better example Humphrys won, so there are some cases in which maybe policy does win through.</p>
<p>The problem is clearly more sophisticated than a popularity contest and I think that is why it is so hard to adress the problems of these elections. I dissaproved of many of Tom Scotts election rules because I felt they reduced transparancy and played up to the popularity contest element. Lets just hope his proposed electoral reform isn&#039;t so contentious and may adress this problem for next year.</p>

<p>#33 because personality matters more than policy.</p>
<p>Policies rarely get enacted, except for ones about personality. Its a lot easier to pledge to be approachable than it is to get more cash machines, cutlasses for all or lighting in rape alley.</p>
<p>Each job is far too constraining to actually put policies into action, and the budget certainly won&#039;t allow for some policies. You might have a political genius running, but if they can&#039;t communicate with people well, they&#039;re not going to do a very good job as an officer.</p>
<p>So yes, it&#039;s all a personality contest. Thats not just a flippant disillusioned comment, it&#039;s just remarking on how being visible when campaigning will always be more important than a few promises.</p>

<p>This election just proved how much of a popularity contest YUSU really is.<br />
I have heard people saying &quot;Fix up, vote Sharp is catchy, so I will vote for him&quot;. What about policies? It&#039;s only a matter of campaigning. I&#039;ve read people&#039;s opinions, stating that they will only vote for people who are visible. Why?! The fact that they have excess free time does not make them better candidates. People complain about YUSU&#039;s state, yet when it is up to them to vote for the best person, they just vote for people they&#039;ve seen around campus, without even knowing their policies!<br />
And I am not against Kinchin, but her campaign was just a proof that she cared for publicity more than she cared for policies. What does nakedness have to do with student activities?</p>
<p>It becomes blatantly obvious that in these elections, people who campaign more win. It is embarrassing if you ask me. In my opinion, candidates should not be allowed to campaign - they should just provide the outline for their posters, and it should be up to YUSU to advertise the elections. Campaigning more does not show greater determination - it shows more free time.<br />
Best,<br />
A.</p>

<p>Just because you have a visible campaign doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;ll be a friendly, approachable person. I think some people are confusing the two things here.</p>
<p>I didn&#039;t see Ngwena&#039;s campaigners or campaign material much around campus, but I do think he won based on the support from those in Fusion/Bad Taste, 2 groups which have a large number of members.</p>
<p>I feel that Langrish or Bradley would have been much more approachable than Ngwena. Oh well, as #35 remarked, it&#039;s not like the new officers can implement any sort of significant change. No wonder students are so disillusioned with YUSU.</p>
