		<div class="SubText">The Yorker reported live from The Courtyard, bringing you the latest news as it came in. We voiced your views, we spoke to candidates and current officers and had fun throughout the night. We hope you enjoyed it too!</div>

        <p><em>Additional reporting from Chris Travis, Antonia Moura, Rachel Basch, Chloe Dean, Claire Curtis and Laura Lennkh.</em></p>
<p><strong>Check back over the next few days for further coverage and comments.</strong></p>
<p><strong>01:51</strong> According to Tom Scott our elections have seen the highest turnout of all the universities in the country. Although 23% isn&#039;t exactly impressive.</p>
<p>As the night draws to a close we can&#039;t help but note the amount of discontent amongst students, who said apathy is dead?</p>
<p><strong>01:50</strong> Our new YUSU President Elect Tim Ngwena says: &quot;I feel very good, I feel relieved, very relieved. It&#039;s been months of hard work.&quot;</p>
<p>Reflecting on the year ahead Ngwena voices positive views: &quot;I think the team is great, they represent the students and even though it was very close in certain cases, it just goes to show the calibre of the candidates.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>01:47</strong> Former YUSU presidential candidate Bushby told <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>: &quot;I think we&#039;re going to have another year of uneffectual [sic] leadership. Tom deserved to win tonight. I&#039;m disappointed with tonight&#039;s results. I don&#039;t think we are gonna see the development, improvement and growth of York University that we deserved. I&#039;m glad I&#039;m graduating this year.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>01:44</strong> Former YUSU Ac&amp;Welf Officer, Grace Fletcher-Hackwood told us: &quot;I&#039;m disappointed two of my good friends lost. I find it disappointing personally. Langrish worked really hard over a long period.&quot; She has stressed that she thinks &quot;the union will be in safe hands.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>01:39</strong> &quot;Student fucking politics is dead!&quot; exclaims one student.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../../photos/large/3198.jpg" alt="" /><br /></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>01:34</strong> 24% turn out...</p>

<ul><li>Grant Bradley - 177

</li><li>Charles Bushby - 226

</li><li>Tom Langrish - 118

</li><li>Tim Ngwena - 1202
</li></ul>
<p><strong>01:33</strong> The crowds roar as the names of the candidates are announced...</p>
<p>Tom Scott announces: &quot;In 3 months, someone is going to take over from me. They&#039;re going to have the worst job and the best job they will ever have.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>01:31</strong> They&#039;re playing the final countdown in L/N/028...</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>Bushby, in a drunken state, has told us &quot;Tim shouldn&#039;t win! Tim can&#039;t win! The YUSU clan needs to be broken down, we need change!&quot; Very strong words, but the exit polls suggest he won&#039;t be the man to make such a change... We&#039;ll have to wait and see though!</p>
<p><strong>01:26</strong> Lewis Bretts tells <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> reporter Claire Curtis: &quot;I&#039;m glad it&#039;s all over!&quot; He says he&#039;s &quot;really excited about it all&quot; and is &quot;very serious about all my policies, I feel I&#039;ve set realistic ones.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>01:18</strong> With only one position left the candidates, if you didn&#039;t know already, are as follows:</p>

<ul><li>Grant Bradley

</li><li>Charles Bushby

</li><li>Tom Langrish

</li><li>Tim Ngwena
</li></ul>

<p>Bretts takes the stage: &quot;Being a candidate is a bit weird. Every single person who has put a poster up: I can&#039;t tell you how much I appreciate it.

I thought it&#039;d be right down to the wire.&quot; Describing it as &quot;eighteenth months in the waiting&quot; she can&#039;t wait to &quot;focus more on sport with no more degree getting in the way!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>00:54</strong> Elected student Activities Officer (and ex-Yorkerite) Kinchin speaks to YSTV as students dance to &#039;I see you baby&#039;. The whole place is packed as we await the last two results: Democracy &amp; Services and President.</p>

<p><strong>00:36</strong> York Sport results are about to be announced. &quot;Scott, Scott, Scott!&quot; can be heard from L/N/028. Looks like a landslide for Scott...</p>
<p><strong>00:31</strong> Following vigorous interviews with YSTV, URY and Nouse we finally get a hold of our new Welfare Officer, Humphrys. &quot;I didn&#039;t expect such a big win, especially because of the quality of the other candidates.&quot; He told us he&#039;s &quot;very flattered and pleased.&quot; He seems keen to get stuck in!</p>
<p><strong>00:27</strong> With our blogging team so close to the bar (strategic positioning!) we can see The Courtyard appears to be making a killing. Burton comments that: &quot;I wouldn&#039;t say it makes so much, it&#039;s all recycled into the union. As long as everyone is having a good time that&#039;s all that matters!&quot;</p>

<p><strong>00:01</strong> HAPPY BIRTHDAY MARIE!</p>
<p>Watch out for Academic Officer and Welfare Officer results in the next few minutes!</p>
<p><strong>00:00</strong> In a move that mirrors last year&#039;s AU President mess up we saw the first round showing, incorrectly, that Moldova and Ball win had won by 2 votes, whereas the actual results showed that Vince &amp; Medley were in the lead, which became clear on the second round. What a close one!</p>
<p><strong>23:57</strong> Rumours suggest that Jenny Coyle, Welfare candidate, has no idea who has been elected so far. Watch this space for Welfare results!</p>
<p><strong>23:57</strong> Current LGBT Officer Sarah Fennell told <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>: &quot;I&#039;m really pleased with doorsafe. I think they did a fantastic job and I think the fact that something like that has happened really shows how important LGBT officers are! People wonder whether or not we&#039;re needed, and clearly we are.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>23:52</strong> Women&#039;s Officer Ellie Kuper Thomas told <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span>: &quot;Homophobia should NEVER be accepted on campus. It should be noted that that it was a woman who challenged him and a second woman who challenged him and brought doorsafe to the scene.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>23:48</strong> Two of our Yorker reporters are being interviewed by YSTV. How exciting!</p>
<p><strong>23:44</strong> A fight broke out following chants of &quot;You queer bastards!&quot; Doorsafe forced a man to the ground and threw him out the back door after a woman complained about his inappropriate comments and aggressive behaviour.</p>

<p>I wish people would stop dismissing Tim as &#039;just having won due to Fusion and Bad Taste support.&#039;. Whether he won mainly due to votes from people within those groups is irrelevant - he wouldn&#039;t have had support from them unless he&#039;d done a good job running them. People don&#039;t automatically vote for someone within their society. York after all is a very small Uni - and so if being in the same society as one candidate meant voting for them, a lot of my votes would have been split at least 2 ways. Obviously being close friends with someone is different (and along those lines, it&#039;ll always to an extent be a popularity contest) but a mere acquaintance with someone isn&#039;t enough to insure votes. So, Tim&#039;s election, whether we agree that he should have won or not, is due to him doing a good job with both his campaign and the things he&#039;s done in the past.</p>

<p>I think that some of the people who have commented on this thread really need to accept that just because they feel that the &quot;wrong&quot; candidate was elected, be it on the grounds of pure social popularity or lack of experience, that unfortunately the majority of voters did indeed prefer this candidate and hence this implies that they feel more represented by the candidate whom they have elected, regardless of their campaigning methods, policies or personality.  This is how democracy functions.  I also found it extremely cringe worthy when campus journalists made reference to Tim&rsquo;s race after he won the election.   I fail to see why in the society we live, why Tim&rsquo;s race should have had any bearing on his ability to win the election as comparing the voters of York University to the US is severely out of context to put it lightly.  I really hope that line of reporting is dropped as; quite frankly it was quite embarrassing to hear.</p>

<p>Can people realise that Fusion and Bad Taste do not comprise 1300 votes!!!! When people saw or spoke to Tim they saw an average student like themselves which they liked and lots of people he hadnt any connection with chose him.</p>
<p>I admire Langrish&#039;s campaign, but it in the end, unfortunately for him, it fell short.</p>

But seriously, I appreciate the time restraints from candidates course, but isn&#039;t that the point of a campaign team? If people believe in your policies and ability as a candidate they will be more than happy to give up their time and energy to campaigning on your behalf, which does raise visibility, but also reflects a good candidate who can motivate individuals.</p>
<p>Aside from George&#039;s comment, on this whole popularity issue, surely these people are popular for a reason? I personally don&#039;t enjoy the company of people I feel I cant empathises with, rely on and work with. It&#039;s like being back at school reading some of these comments, the world doesn&#039;t work like that. It&#039;s intellectually cretinous to insult the electorate and suggest they only vote for the most charming candidates.</p>

<p>At least I have the decency of posting under my name, so that people can criticise me.<br />
I have never moaned about my personal lack of time. I never said I do not have a life, I never said I do not have time for extra-curricular activities.</p>
<p>As I said, the fact that some people have the time to campaign nine to five does not mean they want the position more than the rest.<br />

<ul id="CommentItem6628History" class="comment_edit"><li>Sun, 15th Mar 2009 3:00pm - Edited by the author</li></ul><p>That&#039;s got nothing to do with 49&#039;s point. Aristidis you&#039;ve said that it is embarrassing that those who campaigned the most have won. What is actually embarrassing is your complete disdain for the decision making of your peers. People should be allowed to campaign, this is what makes democracy more transparent and accessible. Why do you think so many people feel disconnected from YUSU? Are you honestly suggesting that for candidates to purely list their policies would be better for the electorate? (which to be honest is who the candidate&#039;s should be most concerned with)I&#039;d feel pretty disenfranchised if I didn&#039;t know much more about the sabbs than their policies. There is so much more to these roles than what the individuals pledge to do (which may or not be achievable).<br />
Secondly, you call this a popularity contest, and I hark back to 49 on this one.People are popular because they are admired, admirable qualities are no bad thing. I don&#039;t for a minute believe this was a popularity vote, but if you want to be so base about all this then I put this to you: Do you not think, by definition the most popular candidate would be the most beneficial for the electorate? Given the qualities they are likely to exhibit. Policies are all well and good, but they need to be enacted well, and if good policies are aired during the election which plants the idea in those who can enact them then surely this is no bad thing for the student body as a whole?</p>

			<p>&quot;George, Charlie L battered that Ron fellow without any publicity? So how&#039;s that for high publicity.&quot;</p>
<p>As if Charlie did not have high publicity in the first place. In fact, Charlie is so popular (and rightly so if you ask me) that nobody even bothered running against her - nobody would stand a chance. I am sure you understand that this can&#039;t be used as an argument.</p>
<p>As for the time constraints. Yes a campaign team can help, which is the reason why I launched a campaign in the first place, but a campaign team needs to be organised and coordinated. And still, the amount of time a candidate has to dedicate to all this is very considerable (and to that add hustings, URY, interviews, speaking to committees etc. etc.).</p>
<p>In any case, this is all irrelevant. This is not about me and I only responded originally because I was insulted in a completely uncalled-for manner.</p>
<p>The issue here is that higher publicity proved to be synonymous to victory in these elections. I find this fact to be rather disheartening and I will try to make sure it is addressed in the election review.</p>
<p>Of course, higher publicity and ability are not mutually exclusive. I do believe for example that Lewis is going to do a brilliant job.</p>
<p>But the fact of the matter is that this process inherently favours publicity, often at the greatest expense of seriousness and policies.</p>

<p>&quot;And for positions like President, or Policy and Campaigns - the ability to run a high profile, effective campaign is INTEGRAL to the position&quot;</p>
<p>Only Campaigns now, Policy has been pushed into Chair of Council and the others <img src="../../../images/smileys/rasberry.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>It&#039;s not JUST a popularity contest. We saw how second preferences made a massive difference, for a start - but the element of visibility definitely helped.</p>
<p>Fusion definitely didn&#039;t give 1300 votes - but how can we tell that of the thousands attending the display didn&#039;t give an extra boost? Or maybe he would have won more but it took up some of his time? Maybe Rhianna&#039;s mostly-naked men helped boost the campaign or maybe people didn&#039;t like it? Maybe some people thought that Rory had done a good job at the society forum and others didn&#039;t like it? Maybe some people voted on who they thought was fit, maybe they thought that women are more approachable, maybe they wanted change or maybe the women were simply better candidates. There&#039;s no real way of telling how much each factor affected the results - in the same way as you can&#039;t tell how much of the RON vote was because people didn&#039;t like the uncontested factor, people didn&#039;t like our party allegiances (I have a friend who voted RON against us because I was running with a tory, despite liking Chris!) or maybe they just hated us.</p>
<p>Everything plays a part in this and when you have tiny majorities - especially the kind in the LGBT election - who knows what the final factor was? You just have to cope with the results and move on - if they&#039;re that close then obviously both will be similarly good in the students&#039; minds.</p>
<p>What I find is interesting is that of the Sabbs, half are women, a sixth isn&#039;t caucasian and a sixth is LGBT - and I think that it&#039;s actually fairly representative of the student populace. It will be interesting to see whether that level of representation will improve YUSU&#039;s approachability or not! Hopefully so <img src="../../../images/smileys/smile.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Thomas,<br />
why is my disdain embarrassing? It is very well justified.<br />
So what did you learn about Rhianna through her campaign? How did packs of cereals hint to her personality? Or her naked campaigners?<br />
I hardly think that these examples increase YUSU&#039;s transparency? And it is policies that should concern you, not personality. The important thing is to have someone who can run YUSU properly.<br />
And my point was not about popularity as much as it was for publicity. What qualities does Sharp&#039;s motto exhibit? Still, people found it catchy, and voted for him on these grounds. Does that make him admirable? Or do you think that, because he was able to come up with a good campaign, he would make a good officer?<br />

<p>In the welfare race Matt Pallas was more visible than Ben Humphrys and Jenny Coyle had the gimmicky campaign with half-naked men with &quot;Vote Jenny Welfare&quot; and a penis drawn on their chests. She had immense popularity but still in the end Ben won by a decent margin. So at least in one of the races popularity wasn&#039;t the deciding factor. Although Ben is also very popular and quite hot too!</p>
<p>Rory has done a great job in many areas but a lot of the people running societies don&#039;t like him, which had to count for something.</p>
<p>Lewis fought a great campaign with excellent publicity for his policies and he won based on that.</p>
<p>As for president... most people don&#039;t really know what the president does. Tom wrote the constitution and would have been perfect at standing up to the university when needed. Tim will probably be a better communicator to campus at large.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the results are in. The elections truly showed the worth of every single vote (if two people who RONd both candidates had changed their second preference, the MJ people would have won).<br />
Last year people wanted to no confidence Scott, who did an OK job. Lets allow this years candidates to do the same and only attack them if they go wrong.</p>

<p>I can&#039;t comment on Rhianna&#039;s campaign. However with regards to David Sharp I doubt the only reason people voted for was because of catchy campaign, he was chair of one of the biggest colleges on campus. To be perfectly honestly with you the people you hear saying &#039;ooh i&#039;ll vote for that gimmick&#039; probably dont care and consequently wont even bother voting so i doubt it is that effective, and there is no way of measuring it. Basically it&#039;s embarrassing but it insults the intelligence of the rest of us. I think your naive to think people voted entirely on such flippant grounds. I suppose the ability to come up with a good idea and run a campaign suggests an individual probably has the skill set necessary to make a good officer.</p>

<p>What?! A catchy slogan suggests that a candidate will make a good officer? Are you serious?<br />
And I am not naive, I am saying that I actually know people who DID vote for Sharp, because, in their own words, his slogan was funny.<br />
And why not comment on Rhianna&#039;s campaign? You yourself discussed how one&#039;s campaign is important because you discover the candidate&#039;s personality. So I am asking you: you cannot have missed her campaign. What did you get out of it? Which skill did it demonstrate, which will qualify her as an officer?<br />

<p>How about the ability to get peoples attention so that they take more notice of a serious issue? Seems pretty important seeing as she&#039;ll be looking after RAG. Or even how about a sense of humour? It shows that she&#039;s human and not some whiney, serious student politician, and perhaps, unlike you Aris, more in touch with normal students.</p>
