		<div class="SubText">The Yorker talks to the candidates for President -  Grant Bradley, Charles Bushby, Tom Langrish and Tim Ngwena.</div>

        
<ul><li><strong>What is your main reason for running?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Grant Bradley:</strong> A mixture of feeling like I could make a genuine difference and coming to the realisation that I COULD actually run for it... I&#039;ve said quite a lot that if anyone can run I think everyone should, and because hardly anyone did, I&#039;m happier than ever that I&#039;m standing with an opportunity to represent the entire student body, and get everyone&#039;s voices heard.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Bushby:</strong> To provoke change on campus. Specifically I&#039;m looking to improve campus services, reallocate funds to develop societies and activities and foster relations between the YUSU (Courtyard) and the Collegiate system. Even if I don&#039;t win I hope that my campaign will inspire others to implement these necessary changes.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Langrish:</strong> I really want a chance to work full-time for the students at this university. I have enjoyed everything I have done over the last two and a half years but would relish the chance to give one position my all (and not have a degree to worry about).</p>
<p><strong>Tim Ngwena:</strong> Why not? I want to stay involved in university life and I haven&rsquo;t got much planned for next year. I would like to stay in York and a sabbatical position would offer me that opportunity. I&#039;ve chosen to run for the position of President because I want to improve the university experience as well as develop my own personality.</p>

<ul><li><strong>What relevant experience do you have?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>GB:</strong> I currently work at weekends in an environment where I&#039;m training and educating people constantly in regards to certain technologies. I also represent the entire staff to the national management team, and I host my own radio show. All excellent examples of how my communication skills allow me to express the opinions of those around me and still run at my own pace. I&#039;ve also performed with Comedy Society, and so am not afraid to embarrass myself for a greater cause.</p>
<p><strong>CB:</strong> I believe to be a successful president takes a combination of experiences including active participation in facets of university life as well as experiences learnt from real world work experiences. In my case I have actively been involved with the boat club since I&#039;ve joined the university both as a participant who has represented the university at national level as well as being someone who has been involved in the running of the organisation. Some of you may know me from my radio station shows as well as seen me DJing at campus events. I have been an active member of Alcuin College, being a STYC two years in a row. Finally I have seen how organisations are run through completing multiple internships and will draw upon these experiences to run my presidency. I don&#039;t believe that a president needs to have held a former position on the student body.</p>
<p><strong>TL:</strong> Relevant is definitely the key word here. The President has to represent students. I have done this, amongst other things, as a Student Rep for History, Undergraduate Rep on University Senate and delegate to the NUS. The President has to campaign for students and as a Union Officer and Alcuin Vice-Chair, I have campaigned on issues such as saving B. Henry&rsquo;s and extending the library opening hours.  Finally, the President is an officer of the SU and has a responsibility to ensure the organisation runs well. Over the past two years as a Union Officer, I have learned how to get things done and what needs to be changed.</p>
<p><strong>TN:</strong> I am currently Fusion President 2008/09 and Bad Taste Graphics Editor. I was College Sports Captain for James and Athletics Captain also. Owning my own Freelance design studio has also given me a lot of relevant experience, as well as taking part in the Enterprise rent-a-car management trainee scheme. Last year, I came runner up entrepeneur of the year. My experience within campus has included graphics design for YUSU and for a total of seven societies in one year. Lastly, I am a student...</p>

<ul><li><strong>What&#039;s the best thing you have done at university yet?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>GB:</strong> The Comedy Society&#039;s 24 hours of comedy. I performed, I filmed and I edited the entire thing. I met a LOAD of people that night, many of whom became very good friends and it was a real sense of achieving something through a veeeeery long night.</p>
<p><strong>CB:</strong> Besides running for President!! I would have to say making a ton of new friends, with which I have had a number of memorable experiences during my time at York.</p>
<p><strong>TL:</strong> Working at Woodstock for the past two years.  Even when chucking it down with rain, students still turned out to hear some great music and it was all for RAG too.</p>
<p><strong>TN:</strong> Fusion 2009 most definitely because it has been extremely successful and it is well on its way of achieving target of raising &pound;15,000. I helped to coordinate the 435 students involved, as well as helping to raise funds for it. It really is a tribute to all the students involved because they have put in so much time and effort.</p>

<ul><li><strong>What is your guilty pleasure?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>GB:</strong> My phone. I spent a bomb on it at a time when I&#039;d just got out of my overdraft and then another small fortune in music and applications for it. I never put the damn thing down, but it&#039;s so cool and does everything I need.</p>
<p><strong>CB:</strong> Spending time in the company of the beautiful ladies of the University of York!!</p>
<p><strong>TL:</strong> Cans of &lsquo;Relentless&rsquo;. They taste good and are perfect for those 09.15 seminars but I discovered the other day that you definitely can have too much of a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>TN:</strong> Spending too much time on the internet, looking up updates on new drivers, mobile phones, technological gadgets in general, accessing facebook, twitter, flickr and stumble.</p>

<ul><li><strong>The best book you&#039;ve ever read?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>GB:</strong> <em>Follow Me</em>, by Danny Wallace. I love his unique stance on the world we live in. I&#039;d like to think there&rsquo;s an element of his ballsy-ness in me, but in reality, he&#039;s far, far more intelligent than I am.</p>
<p><strong>CB:</strong> The YUSU campaign rule book takes some beating but it would have to be <em>Confessions of an Economic Hitman</em> by John Perkins. Essentially a criticism of the way the US tries to use its resources to dominate internationally.</p>
<p><strong>TL:</strong> My history degree is slowly eroding my love for reading but I would have to say <em>Wild Swans</em> by Jung Chang.</p>
<p><strong>TN:</strong> <em>Lord of the Flies</em> because it looks at people&rsquo;s psyche, which I also enjoy doing. It shows how children can eventually reach the stage of community interaction that we have now, albeit slower than adults, similar to the television show <em>Tribe</em>.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Who is your idol?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>GB:</strong> Don&#039;t really have one. That&#039;s not to say there aren&#039;t a lot of amazing, wonderful, passionate and caring people in the
world, but at the end of the day, they&#039;re all human. They, like us have faults. So rather than idolizing them, I appreciate individuals for what they do or have done, but I never put anyone up on too high of a pedestal.</p>
<p><strong>CB:</strong> Henry James Foy.</p>
<p><strong>TL:</strong> Don&rsquo;t really have an idol but I really admire the actor Morgan Freeman.</p>
<p><strong>TN:</strong> Will Smith because he has a great range of talent, with a dynamic character. He generally generates a good feeling around other people, which is what I hope that I do.</p>
<p><strong>The one person (alive or dead) you want to have dinner with?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GB:</strong> My dad (as wussy as it sounds); he always makes me feel confident in what I&#039;m doing, encourages me to reach for the best I can and picks up the tab!</p>
<p><strong>CB:</strong> Tony Blair - what was your mandate as special envoy to the middle east and when will we see results? Otherwise Tom Scott, to discuss my campaign with him.</p>
<p><strong>TL:</strong> I think a Roman banquet with Julius Caesar would be pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>TN:</strong> Beyonce Knowles because having dinner with someone should be relaxing and enjoyable. If I wanted to have dinner with a philosopher to talk about philosophical ideas, I would read a philosophical journal!</p>

<ul><li><strong>Why should students vote for you (in less than five words)?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>GB:</strong> Because &quot;We will act as one&quot;</p>
<p><strong>CB:</strong> I am &#039;Chuck Bushby&#039;</p>
<p><strong>TL:</strong> My experience, policies and passion</p>
<p><strong>TN:<em> Dynamic, determined, approachable, charismatic, chilled.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>QUICK FIRE</strong></p>

<ul><li><strong>Going out/Staying in?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>GB:</strong> Going out</p>
<p><strong>CB:</strong> Staying in and watching a Chick Flick</p>
<p><strong>TL:</strong> Going out</p>
<p><strong>TN:</strong> Going out</p>
<p>2. <strong>Ziggy&#039;s/Gallery?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GB:</strong> Gallery</p>
<p><strong>CB:</strong> Neither - Trusday FTW!!</p>
<p><strong>TL:</strong>Gallery</p>
<p><strong>TN:</strong> Ziggy&#039;s</p>

<ul><li><strong>Porridge/Cereal?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>GB:</strong> Cereal</p>
<p><strong>CB:</strong> Frosties --- They&#039;re Greeeaaaattt!!</p>
<p><strong>TL:</strong> Cereal</p>
<p><strong>TN:</strong> Porridge</p>

<ul><li><strong>Jeans/tracksuits?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>GB:</strong> Jeans</p>
<p><strong>CB:</strong> Jeans on the short side accompanied by red socks.</p>
<p><strong>TL:</strong> Jeans</p>

<p>What relevant experience do you have?<br />
&quot;I have seen how organisations are run through completing multiple internships and will draw upon these experiences to run my presidency&quot;</p>
<p>What&#039;s the best thing you have done at university yet?<br />
&quot;I would have to say making a ton of new friends, with which I have had a number of memorable experiences during my time at York&quot;</p>
<p>Who is your idol?<br />
&quot;Henry James Foy&quot;</p>
<p>Why should students vote for you (in less than five words)?<br />
&quot;I am Chuck Bushby&quot; (what?)</p>
<p>Going out/Staying in?<br />
&quot;Staying in and watching a Chick Flick&quot;</p>
<p>Does Chuck ever say anything interesting?</p>
<p>And he doesnt seem to get the multiple choice thing either:;</p>
<p>Ziggy&#039;s/Gallery - neither<br />
Porridge/Cereal - Frosties<br />
Jeans/tracksuits - short with red socks<br />
Coffee/vodka - both</p>
<p>Whats wrong with this man? I dont understand him so I&#039;m not going to vote for him. Its all very strange</p>

<p>The standout answer here for me was:</p>
<p>Why are you running?<br />
Tim Ngwena: Why not? I want to stay involved in university life and I haven&rsquo;t got much planned for next year.</p>
<p>I think this proves once and for all what a popularity contest the YUSU elections are</p>

<p>Well done #4 lets just misrepresent what someone says the rest of the answer:</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to stay in York and a sabbatical position would offer me that opportunity. I&#039;ve chosen to run for the position of President because I want to improve the university experience as well as develop my own personality.&quot;</p>
<p>Shows Tim&#039;s true intentions. I wish people would stop being so bitter about the winning Sabbs and get on with it. Langrish has done so in a very distinguished fashion in the media so I wish his supporters would follow suit.</p>

<p>Sean, the answer hardly needed misrepresenting in the first place. I was a supporter of Tom, and I am bitter that he lost to someone who&#039;s first response to why he wanted the job was &#039;Why not?&#039;. #4 is spot on, it was a popularity contest and everyone knows it, and the worst thing is the vast majority of people would probably admit it.</p>

<p>What&#039;s wrong with saying &quot;Why not&quot;? All he has done is suggest that there are a huge variety of reasons for wanting to stand as President and very few reasons not to stand.</p>
<p>Also, Marcus, it might do you well to remember that these are merely student elections, nothing is really going to change that much. I doubt that in a years time Tim will have done anything significant that Tom wouldn&#039;t have done or that if Tom had won it he would have done anything significant that Tim wouldn&#039;t have done. As for being bitter don&#039;t be so pathetic. Tom was obviously gutted when he lost the election and I feel sorry for him as he put in a lot of hard work but he has shown himself to be a good bloke by accepting it and getting on with life, I am sure he wishes Tim all the best and believes he will do a good job, maybe you should take note of this!</p>

<p>Grant also stood on a &#039;why not&#039; platform. Personally I think it&#039;s a pretty arrogant thing to say - as if someone wants to win an election just for the hell of it, just because they can.</p>
<p>Tom did seem the natural candidate for the job, but these elections show that experience on all the committees in the world won&#039;t get you as many votes as coordinating massive events.</p>
<p>There&#039;s always a bit of annoyance at the result, it was much much worse last year, talks of no confidencing the pirate minutes after the election! But lets face it, even the pirate didn&#039;t screw up when we all thought he would.</p>
<p>Lets give the new president a chance. I reckon he&#039;ll do as good a job as anyone else could do. Never heard of the guy before but he seemed a good communicator and certainly knows an awful lot of people through sports, performances, media and business. Thats a fairly all-round CV!</p>

<p>I would love to know how many of these people who discredit Tim have actually talked to him in person about University issues... I wager a massive none.</p>
<p>He did a huge amount of research in preparation for the elections and is carrying that on now.</p>
<p>I can&#039;t comment on Tom Langrish&#039;s competency because I have not talked to him, the same goes for Tim for others. He will activate so many new society/sports members into the world of YUSU that would have been totally apathetic otherwise.</p>
<p>I agree with Vision (for once) - the elections of Tim, Bretts and Kinchin were a rejection of a perceived (rightly or wrongly) YUSU clique. The more people that label it a popularity contest the more it confirms that assertion.</p>
<p>Some people only want democracy if it goes there own way. The people have spoken so lets support the Sabbs.</p>

<p>I&#039;m with Sean on this one. The Presidential race always seemed for me to be between Tim and Tom, and my personal opinion was (and still is) that either would make a fantastic President. It&#039;s unfortunate that Tom won&#039;t get that chance, but more people voted for Tim and I think we should let him start work rather than pre-judge him.</p>

<p>&quot;Tim, Bretts and Kinchin were a rejection of a perceived (rightly or wrongly) YUSU clique.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#039;m not entirely sure this is true. Lewis has been heavily involved with YUSU Ents. and RAG in his 2 years here (he went to America in 2nd year). Kinchin has also been massively involved with YUSU during her 3 years here. She was YUSU Training Officer (the same as Langrish in Yr 1) during &#039;08/&#039;09 and a YUSU trustee in the summer of &#039;08. Even Tim said in his speech that he has &#039;done stuff with/in YUSU&#039;.</p>
<p>Whilst I&#039;d agree, the three candidates are perhaps &#039;less YUSU&#039; than the 3 who happened to lose. I don&#039;t think you can claim it&#039;s an outright rejection of the YUSU clique. It is, dare I say, typically simplistic Vision reporting. I&#039;d say (rightly or wrongly) it was more down to visible, populist campaigns that are always successful in elections with an apathetic electorate.</p>

<p>Sean, how do you substantiate the statement, &quot;Some people only want democracy if it goes there own way.&quot;</p>
<p>No one is rejecting the legitimacy of the election; saying it was fixed or wrongly conducted. They are saying they don&#039;t like the result. Under &#039;democracy&#039;, they are more than entitled to do that. There is a massive difference between not liking the very concept of democracy and not liking its results.</p>
<p>I can&#039;t see anyone on this wall saying that systematically, the very fact that we were able to vote, was wrong. The outcome just didn&#039;t go their way. That&#039;s not &#039;not liking democracy&#039;.</p>

<p>I concede Dan&#039;s points and I agree with them as I dispute the myth of a cavenous YUSU clique.</p>
<p>#16 I&#039;m taking issue with the accusation its a popularity contest, as in reality, democratic elections are by their very nature.</p>
<p>In a close fought battle between two very close candidates policy choice was not a differentiating attribute for voters. It came down to personality and Tim won this battle and campaigned very hard to get out their and talk face to face with people.</p>
<p>I agree with Ben too, Tom would have made a great President but the choice has been made now and being bitter doesn&#039;t help anyone, least of all Tom Langrish whose good name is getting tarnished I feel by people&#039;s unfair criticism of Tim.</p>
