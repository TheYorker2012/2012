		</div>
		<div class="SubText">The seven College Chairs have released individual statements giving their opinion on the no-confidence vote against Chet Khatu.</div>

        <p>The statements came in the wake of a <a href="../2042.html">second statement</a> issued by the James JCRC to its students.</p>


<h3> David Sharp &ndash; Halifax President </h3>

<p>&ldquo;When I first heard of the vote of no confidence I thought it was some horrible joke; after finding out it was not a joke I was outraged by the decision. Every meeting I have been in with Chet and every time I have had any discussions with him he has had James College&#039;s interests at heart; I feel that the James JCRC has made a mistake in taking him out of university politics as any college would be lucky to have a chair who will fight for their colleges cause as much as Chet does.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously I cannot comment on his approach to the James JCRC meetings but I am shocked at what I have heard based on what I have seen from Chet. It is a real shame and a genuine set-back to student politics at the University of York.&quot;</p>


<h3> Oliver Lester &ndash; Derwent Chair </h3>

<p>&quot;It was genuinely a shock when I heard about Chet&rsquo;s vote of no-confidence. From personal experience, he has proved himself to be dedicated, hard working and 100% in love with his college. He is constantly working to improve inter-college relationships and from what I&rsquo;ve read, he has worked hard to fulfil his campaign promises. I, and I know quite a few other Derwenters, were green with envy that he managed to secure Sky for his common room!</p>
<p>&quot;Being a chair isn&rsquo;t the easiest; you put a lot of hard work behind the scenes that often goes overlooked. I can&rsquo;t comment on his performance within his JCRC, but working with him was an absolute pleasure. Chet is enthusiastic, motivated and a great bloke and as said before, this is a complete loss to student politics.&quot;</p>


<h3> Matt Oliver &ndash; Vanbrugh Chair </h3>

<p>&quot;I support Chet&#039;s reinstatement because he has consistently shown himself to be an excellent chair. Not only has he worked hard (and successfully) to deliver the campaign promises that he made, but he has shown great commitment to working between colleges in order to improve the University for everyone, not just James students.</p>
<p>&quot;Irrelevant of people&#039;s personal opinions, his role as Chair is to lead and in my experience with Chet he has done that admirably. The process used to remove him, though constitutional, was undemocratic in the extreme and makes a mockery of the people who work incredibly hard to improve the student experience. I believe that if reinstated Chet will continue to be a brilliant chair, and continue to make a huge difference to James students and to the wider University.&quot;</p>


<h3> Erik O&rsquo;Connor &ndash; Alcuin Chair </h3>

<p>&quot;Chet has been a valuable member of YUSU Senate, and consistently supported other JCR Chairs, always providing a helpful perspective and a powerful insight into the dynamics of campus democracy. I therefore found it difficult to understand the vote of no confidence that ousted him. Having said that, I can understand that there might be issues beyond my knowledge, which have shaped this outcome.</p>
<p>&quot;As someone who is not a member of the James JCR, I have no say in this matter, but I would encourage the James JCRC to open up for greater discussion than has occurred thus far, as it is clear that there are many James members who were unaware of the developments, and would like to voice their opinions on the matter.&quot;</p>


<h3>Joe Clarke &ndash; Goodricke Chair </h3>

<p>&quot;Chet has done more for James College and for bringing colleges together than any of us thought possible in two terms. The amount of emails that have been going round from senior university staff, praising him, shows the amount of respect that he has from within the student political system.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel that it&#039;s a flaw in the constitution that has allowed this vote to go through, something which should have been ironed out long ago. It seems like a very undemocratic process, especially considering the size of James College, the variety in views between its members and the fact that it wasn&#039;t conducted at an open meeting with a representative sample of James students. Instead it was at a meeting where only 18 people were there to vote on the motion, this represents little over 1% of the students in James. The constitution needs re-evaluating immediately and I fully believe that Chet was, and still could be a great asset to James College.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#039;s time for the students to get in touch with their JCRC, go to the meetings, and let the committee know that they&#039;re outraged.&quot;</p>


<h3>Zach Pepper &ndash; Langwith Chair</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Seeing a vote of no-confidence for any one of this year&#039;s college JCRC chairs would surprise me, but the removal of Chet absolutely astounding, and completely out of the blue.</p>
<p>&quot;Chet has always come across as a true gentleman, and has always got the interests of his college at the forefront of his day-to-day life.</p>
<p>&quot;Being a chair sometimes means doing things that you don&#039;t get any credit for - a lot of work goes on that is &#039;behind the scenes&#039;, and I have seen Chet go above and beyond for his college. I can only assume that those who have taken it upon themselves to remove him are unaware of the amount of work that Chet was doing on their behalf.&quot;</p>

<p>Taken from the &#039;Bring back Chet - the campaign for true democracy&#039; Facebook group.</p>
<p>There have been reports of a Facebook group planning to &quot;Go get &#039;em&quot; at the next JCRC meeting. Exactly what the plan entailed has not been made clear but i would like to state explicitly that I personally, and as the creator of this group DO NOT condone any threats of violence against the JCRC or any member of the college. Whether or not the membership of the more recent group has an overlap with this one is irrelevant.</p>
<p>It is of course worth pointing out that the admins of the group (including Chet) have condemned any form of intimidation, however I think it speaks volumes that this is even an issue</p>

<p>I understand that the JCRC vote was constitutional but i feel utterly cheated out of my vote. I don&#039;t understand why (considering 300 people have joined different facebook groups and clearly have strong opinions about this) James College is not being given the right to vote on such an important issue? I think both sides of the JCRC should be given time to put their argument across to James and let us decide. I honestly feel like my vote was meaningless making student politics even more of a joke than many make out it is.</p>

<p>Tara: It seems that the problem is a catch-22 situation for James. They could either ignore the constitution and give members the right to a vote over the issue, hence making a mockery of student politics and the people who voted in that constitution, or they could follow the procedures outlined in the constitution that was voted in, and then get accused of making a mockery of student politics by ignoring the people who voted Chet in.</p>
