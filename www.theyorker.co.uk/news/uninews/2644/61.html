		<div class="SubText">Nominations for this year&rsquo;s YUSU elections open on Monday. The Yorker looks at some of the students rumoured to be running for President.</div>

        <p><em>Please note, these are only rumours and the students listed have not spoken to <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>.</em></p>
<p><em>Candidates are not permitted to campaign until Tuesday week 8.</em></p>

<ul><li><strong>Tom Langrish</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>Langrish would certainly stand a good chance in the election, having a wealth of experience. He is the current YUSU Policy and Campaigns Officer with Michael Batula, and is also currently the Chair of YUSU Council and a GSA Returning Officer.</p>
<p>His previous experience includes positions as Alcuin Vice-Chair for Welfare and Support and YUSU Training Officer last year. Additionally, he has been a History Board of Studies Rep since 2006.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Matt Oliver</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>Third-year English student Matt Oliver was the Vanbrugh Chair last year. He is also a keen sports player, and was part of the Vanbrugh football side that won the 2nds League last year.</p>
<p>Oliver is very popular within his college, but only time will tell how far that popularity reaches outside Vanbrugh.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Dan Taylor</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>Third-year History and Politics student Dan Taylor is perhaps most famous for the incident which led to Grace Fletcher-Hackwood being no-confidenced last year. His previous experience includes his position as Derwent Vis Ents Rep last year with Will Marle.</p>
<p>Taylor is also a regular for the Derwent rugby team. He was due to run for Services and Finance Officer last year, promising to give Matt Burton &quot;a good run for his money&quot;, but he withdrew at the last minute.</p>

<ul><li><strong>YUSU ELECTIONS TIMELINE</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>Nominations Open: Mon week 6</p>
<p>Nominations Close: Fri week 7</p>
<p>Campaigning Begins: Tues week 8</p>
<p>Hustings: Tues and Weds week 8</p>
<p>Toilet Postering: Week 9 (tbc)</p>

<p>Of course i know what&#039;s going on because i&#039;ve been told that my name has been mentioned on <span class="theyorker">the yorker</span>.</p>
<p>I am well aware that any form of campaigning at this point is not allowed and so i am not condoning the posts.</p>
<p>However, i find the serious manner that people are giving the posts which people have clearly posted as a joke is pathetic. I am not involved with this.</p>
<p>If i do run for YUSU welfare then it will not be as a joke, i will be a serious candidate who cares about this university.</p>
<p>My facebook status merely reflects the light-hearted way in which i have decided to take <span class="theyorker">the yorker</span>s anonymous comments.</p>

			<p>Alright that&#039;s enough, this person is clearly breaking campaign rules by being advertised in week 6, which is an issue that I will be raising with YUSU.</p>
<p>Jenny, the fact that you are &#039;not condoning&#039; the posts does not mean that you or your friends are not behind them.</p>
<p>Otherwise, who&#039;s writing them and who else would know that you&#039;re running given that you are not allowed to say it?</p>
<p>This is extremely unfair for the other candidates who are playing by the rules and I suggest you put an end to it.</p>
<p>I am worried that after Tom Scott&#039;s success elections will simply not be taken seriously any more...</p>

<p>I can not stop people posting anything, and i doubt someone typing &#039;jenny coyle is my hero&#039; is really going to sway york university voters.</p>
<p>If the posts particularly offend you in anyway then please feel free to report them as i am sure this will lead to the removal of them.</p>
<p>And i would also like to remind you that york university is one big rumour mill...and so people posting my name with regards to YUSU welfare does not necessarily mean that i am running for that position.</p>
<p>My suggestion is you lighten up just a little bit..</p>

<p>It was not one innocent comment Jenny, it was a series of campaign ads that clearly constituted a conscious attempt to get your name heard and create a stir. And I am sure that your own friends would listen to you if you&#039;d tell them to stop it..</p>

<p>Did i state that it was one innocent comment? no, so please don&#039;t misquote me. My friends are 21 years of age and so if they are the culprits of these posts then, as adults, i don&#039;t actually have any control over them.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from YUSU though regarding your complaint and will take any advice on board regarding the election rules and regulations which i must follow if i do decide to run for a YUSU position.</p>

<p>In fairness, I&#039;d say about 5-10 people regularly read the comments section on <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>. The above quotes will have either made them all fanatical Jenny Coyle fans, made them hate her or, more likely, they won&#039;t give a damn.</p>
<p>Just lighten up about it. If she&#039;s running for welfare, then a few posts about it by her Vanbrugh posse make no difference.</p>
<p>As for her &#039;welfare&#039; experience, lets leave that down to the elections. She has as much right to stand or not to stand as anyone, fact.</p>

<ul id="CommentItem5703History" class="comment_edit"><li>Wed, 18th Feb 2009 1:10am - Edited by the author</li></ul><p>I would say that a fair few more than 10 having been reading this thread with interest.</p>
<p>She hasn&#039;t got a massive wealth of YUSU experience and I had assumed that the comments were simply people jumping on an anonymous comedy bandwagon; whether she will go for Welfare or not doesn&#039;t really matter at this point. People won&#039;t know much about her life so you can&#039;t tell if she hasn&#039;t been involved in a ton of extra-university stuff. People have different strengths.</p>
<p>In terms of this particular thread, she has no control over other people. <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> would have a responsibility, if IP addresses matched, to report to YUSU that she had been campaigning anonymously but I suspect that she hasn&#039;t. She has deliberately refused to comment one way or another and has said that she doesn&#039;t support the poster. If it was up to me, she wouldn&#039;t get penalised for it.</p>
<p>Likewise the fact that I can say that Ben Humphreys has been a great LGBT Officer, Matt Pallas has been involved heavily and focussed on Welfare, George Papadofragakis cares a lot and has been a great ISA Welfare Officer but in the end it doesn&#039;t really mean anything. The point is not what they have done but what they will do and if Jenny Coyle has only been involved in a tanning society but cares a lot about welfare, will take the role seriously and has great ideas for improvements then good luck to her.</p>
<p>I sincerely doubt she&#039;d consider running against bigger names if she didn&#039;t think she had a chance or any experience. In the end, another serious contender will make the others campaign harder and make the election get more attention, which can only be good!</p>
<p>Just to clarify: I haven&#039;t heard of anyone considering Welfare that I don&#039;t think could do the job and each has their own strengths.</p>

<p>Experience means nothing - a Student Union position doesn&#039;t require any experience, anyone can run and do a decent job.</p>
<p>Its not like skills from other jobs aren&#039;t transferrable to a sabbatical position or committee position at the SU. Any training is done on the job anyway.</p>
<p>Lets not get bogged down in discussions about experience. Its a student representitive position, not bomb disposal or brain surgery. Anyone could be SU president if they have authority and leadership skills, regardless of whether they&#039;ve been on a zillion union committees or not.</p>
<p>I think the campaigning rules need to be changed. If a candidate can suffer because another individual advertises them at the wrong time, surely i could sabotage somebody&#039;s campaign by advertising their name on purpose at the wrong time?</p>
<p>As seen with the GSA farce, elections need to keep up with technology. If someone comments on an article, the candidate cannot stop them.</p>
<p>I think those people reporting this thread to YUSU need to grow up, and the people dealing with campaign rules need to ensure candidates are not punished for comments that were not endorsed. Otherwise we might as well get to work sabotaging some campaigns right now, knowing that &#039;advertising&#039; someone you don&#039;t like could lead to their disqualification.</p>

<p>&quot;Lets not get bogged down in discussions about experience. Its a student representitive position, not bomb disposal or brain surgery.&quot;</p>
<p>I don&#039;t think you have any clue how much serious work the Welfare Officer actually does. It&#039;s a very serious role and not something anyone could do. I certainly wouldn&#039;t feel experienced enough for the role; indeed the role of Welfare Officer itself has very little student representation about it. What University Committees do they sit on? Yet they&#039;re in charge of organising a lot, are the highest person within YUSU Welfare and a lot more besides.</p>
<p>To an extent the Student Activities could be anyone that is in a society or volunteers, the Academic Affairs represents student opinion to the University on Academic matters, the President can do a good job if (s)he cares and represents well, the Democracy and Services could do well if (s)he can count... but York Sport needs to be someone with sport experience and Welfare needs to be someone with welfare experience and I&#039;m completely adamant about that.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#039;t want to be in a position of great difficulty, welfare-wise, and have it entrusted to some random student who had amazing publicity but knew nothing at all about the job and couldn&#039;t sympathise with me. Etc.</p>

<p>#73 the new welfare officer gets a month&#039;s training with the previous officer, and the summer to train with other officers and the NUS.</p>
<p>And the SU have a very good permanent welfare officer who assists with this.</p>
<p>There&#039;s a very limited number of welfare positions that would be good experience, and if you&#039;re not LGBT, an international student or a graduate, then opportunities are few and far between. College welfare services are more a referral to the student support office than anything else, womens officers are more about campaigning...</p>
<p>There&#039;s plenty of opportunity for learning the skills involved with the job. Some &#039;unknown&#039; people may have worked in welfare before (One of the candidates last year wasnt in YUSU but had worked in a hospital, for example).</p>
<p>We talk about getting people more involved in the union, yet don&#039;t like the idea of outsiders getting into office. Weird.</p>

<p>It&#039;s safe to say that, were it true, RON would still get hardly any votes.</p>
<p>And I&#039;m all for people getting into office from the outside but I would suggest that a non-sabbatical position would be more appropriate for someone with less YUSU experience. As I said, though, anyone seriously considering a full-time position probably has a good reason to think they can compete!</p>
