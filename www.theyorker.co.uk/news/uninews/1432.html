		<div class="SubText">Dan Taylor has dropped out of the sabbatical elections in which he was set to run as Services and Finance.</div>

        <p>Taylor, a second year History student has told <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> he was only planning on running as he felt Matt Burton, current Services and Finance, would be &quot;bad for university democracy&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;My original reason for running was because Matt Burton was uncontested and I saw this as being bad for university democracy and would have made any Burton victory pretty meaningless. There is now another candidate in the hat so the position will be contested.&quot;</p>
<p></p>

<img src="../../images/prototype/news/quote_close.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
<br /><span class="author">Dan Taylor</span>
</div></blockquote><p>He added that he did not have enough time to dedicate to any campaigning: &quot;An election campaign also takes up a lot of time and effort and I would not have wanted to run half-heartedly. If I was running, I would be in it to win it, but for reasons of time, I felt this could not be achieved.&quot;</p>
<p>As a second year Taylor could still run next year, something he said he would &quot;certainly not rule out&quot;.</p>
<p>As for who he supports, Taylor said: &quot;I will not be offering my support to either of the candidates but wish them the greatest success in their campaigns.&quot;</p>
<p>Latest reports suggest that the position will now be between Burton and Nick Bradley, ex-James College Vice Chair, although a list of candidates will be revealed on Monday at noon on <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>.</p>

<p>Clearly it would have been tight between the three. It was more the timing of the campaign. Had these been held when the GFH issue was still up in the air, I would have run.</p>
<p>Oh and people who slander, why do you do it anonymously? You might not like what I say of what you hear I believe, but at least I don&#039;t use a pseudonym or post &#039;anonymously&#039; when I do. Pluck up, grow a pair and have a constructive debate rather than making inept comments that highlight your entire lack of intelligence.</p>
<p>And yes, roll on next year.</p>

			<p>You&#039;d have chosen to run during the massively-divisive and unpopular GFH affair and slander? I don&#039;t see how it&#039;s &quot;clear&quot; that it would have been tight, unless you&#039;d planned to rig the elections...</p>

			<p>Thank God we have Dan Taylor to protect our democratic righs eh? Mr Taylor entered the race for a sabatical position despite knowing he wouldn&#039;t have the time to do it, despite not really having any commitment to the post or the issues surrounding it, and without any inclination to make a success of it. His determination sprung from a need for &quot;democracy&quot;. His candidacy is another example of a controversy-seeking student at best, reckless negligence towards the students he would be representing at worst. His candidacy makes a mockery of the elections rather than seeking to enshrine democracy in them. Essentially Mr Taylor has sought to do what he did with the whole GFH situation - scream like the self-publicising PR pro he is for attention, cloaking his need for attention under the mask of a righteous crusade and holding a big finger up to the student population of the university and their needs. Far more dangerous that Dan Taylor be elected than a man with a proven capacity for the job be re-elected. Taylor&#039;s definition of &quot;win&quot; is to get &quot;one over&quot; on someone else despite any cost it may bring to his fellow students.</p>

<p>Andy - surely you can grasp that when Mr Taylor&#039;s politics are so extreme that even the campus Conservative Party won&#039;t let him speak for them in any official capacity, he doesn&#039;t have a chance of political success once he&#039;s out in the real world - no party would have him, because he&#039;d simply be too damaging. His university years are his only chance of being noticed, before he has to slink away into the anonymity of the army and put up with anti-war protesters without being able to speak against them. Let&#039;s just be kind, and allow Mr Taylor to stamp his feet and get himself noticed - once he&#039;s out of here, he&#039;ll never be noticed again, and that will be devastating to a person suffering from Taylor&#039;s degree of ego- and mono-mania.</p>

<p>Is it any surprise that people want to remain anonymous? They probably just don&#039;t want to incite Dan Taylor to another hate campaign; against them this time.</p>
<p>This article just serves to highlight again how Taylor&#039;s approach to politics is utterly irrational and impractical.</p>
<p>Plus, suggesting that the comments of others are &#039;inept&#039; and merely highlight an &#039;entire lack of intelligence&#039; isn&#039;t exactly helping to establish fertile ground for a &#039;constructive debate&#039;.</p>

<p>Dear Dan,</p>
<p>What does it matter if they identify themselves or not? They still have valid opinions. Rather than addressing the points raised, you just seem to have attacked the people making them:</p>
<p>&quot;Pluck up, grow a pair and have a constructive debate rather than making inept comments that highlight your entire lack of intelligence.&quot;</p>
<p>That seems to be turning to personal attacks rather than debating the issue at hand - outright insults aren&#039;t generally considered the best way to incite debate.</p>
<p>Oh, and the pedant in me would like to point out that &quot;slander&quot; is verbal defamation, the word you&#039;re looking for is &quot;libel&quot;.</p>
<p>Lots of love,<br />
Mitch</p>

<ul id="CommentItem1538History" class="comment_edit"><li>Sun, 24th Feb 2008 7:07am - Edited by the author</li></ul><p>I personally dislike Dan&#039;s politics, and I think that his tactics are often in very poor taste, but I actually think that he had the right Idea here</p>
<p>Matt has done a good job, and I think he deserves a second term, but equally if he had run uncontested then we would have missed an important opportunity to debate past policies, and to think about new ones.</p>
<p>Dan is undoubtedly controversial, but no-one has ever said he is afraid to say what he thinks particularly when it comes to YUSU politics.</p>
<p>To my mind, that means that he would have provided the perfect opposition to an incumbent. As I say I wouldn&#039;t vote for him, but had he been the only other candidate then I would have applauded him for standing, and giving us an opportunity to criticize and improve on YUSU policy within a rational and sensible framework.</p>
<p>To those above who have been making petty insults, I say two things:</p>
<p> Firstly, doesn&#039;t the fact that he has withdrawn his application since it has become clear Matt is not uncontested suggest that he&#039;s not entirely publicity seeking, and that maybe his decision to stand was in keeping with his stated aims?</p>
<p>And secondly, how do you see Dan&#039;s candidacy as the problem in this race?</p>
<p>Surely Tom Scott is the one whose motives need more scrutiny, perhaps he&#039;s the one who is really &quot;holding a big finger up to the student population of the university and their needs&quot; (*6).</p>
<p>In standing as a &#039;pirate&#039; I think he devalues the role of YUSU president and the work that others over time have put into it in the past, and I think its appalling that he&#039;s prepared to try and turn the election of the leader of an organization responsible for the welfare and wellbeing of over 10,000 people into a joke.</p>
<p>That, I would suggest is far more of a problem, and if you really need to complain and insult someone without engaging in the issues, then I would suggest that the candidate who doesn&#039;t care about any issues might be a better target.</p>

<p>If Tom Scott wins it will more likely prove the lack of seriousness that people approach voting with, rather than that of the candidate himself. It could be argued that it&#039;s a clever, deliberate ploy to appeal to the vast majority of students who don&#039;t care about who runs their union or how it is run.</p>
<p>Whatever his approach to his campaign, it doesn&#039;t necessarily detract from his potential in the role (if he has any - I&#039;m not in a position to judge).</p>
<p>Anyway, I digress.</p>
<p>I have to agree with part of #6&#039;s comment:</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Taylor entered the race for a sabatical [sic] position despite knowing he wouldn&#039;t have the time to do it, despite not really having any commitment to the post or the issues surrounding it&quot;.</p>
<p>Whilst I wouldn&#039;t agree that it was necessarily self-promotion and the voters would doubtless see the aforementioned points, it would make him somewhat of a &quot;token&quot; opposition candidate. I&#039;m not saying he shouldn&#039;t have stood, but it would have been rather pointless - we only need to refer to the recent Labour Party Leadership election for an example of that.</p>

<ol><li>11, I see what you&#039;re saying, but I can&#039;t say I agree with you. Democracy is not strengthened when a candidate has no interest in doing the job, no commitment to doing it, and is running purely because he has decided that the other candidate should not be allowed to run unopposed. In fact, democracy is weakened - the electorate, we are meant to believe, cannot choose to make up their own minds about how they want to vote, and need to be &#039;encouraged&#039; by Dan Taylor. Indeed, had Burton alone been running, he could have been RON-ed, whereas in a Taylor-vs-Burton match, that option simply wouldn&#039;t have been open - people would have been too scared of Dan getting in. People should not run in an election unless they seriously want to do the job - what if he had won?! We&#039;d have elected an (inexperienced) official who by his own admission didn&#039;t want the job, and was only running in the election to prevent another (experienced, proved competent and semi-reliable) candidate getting the job! What a fine day for democracy THAT would be - would that get students more interested in campus politics?
</li></ol>
<p>Which brings us to the Mad Cap&#039;n, who (we are led to believe) is the product of student apathy. Again, I see what you are saying: it is not good news when one of three presidential candidates is doing it for a joke. And many of the same issues apply - one can assume that the Captain is either lying in his policy layout, or not taking the issue terribly seriously; it will be terribly bleak if he does win, and his presence will mess up the voting, since people&#039;s choice of votes will be constrained by considerations of how likely he is to win.</p>
<p>However, the difference between the two lies in the nature of the candidates. It is not terribly difficult to see that Tom Scott is running as a joke, albeit one with a potentially destructive punchline. Dan Taylor, unfortunately, was all too serious. Scott is in fact with the students, in that his candidacy arises out of the serious degree of student apathy - students, we are told, do not care about student politics (even in the recent controversy regarding Grace Fletcher-Hackwood and the Womens&#039; Committee, many people left the UGM in question when those issues were finished with), and his emergence can thus be seen as a response - a joke to have WITH the students, to be played on the po-faced SU and those of us who take the minor points of campus politics all too seriously. Dan Taylor, of course, is also a joke, but of the unwitting variety - is candidature, so we are meant to believe, was deadly serious, and if the election and his campaign against Grace Fletcher-Hackwood had coincided, he tells us, he probably wouldn&#039;t have backed down - reasons he does not explain, but which I for one would be very interested to hear elaborated upon.</p>
<p>Both people should give adequate cause for concern, but in different forms. Tom Scott is in effect a spontaneous warning to YUSU - they need to re-engage with students, because the relationship between the campus population and the body representing it is now so fractured that the former will now only raise their heads either at the scent of blood or to laugh at the joke pirate candidate. Dan Taylor, however, is purely a problem of himself. We have our real second candidate now, who, we presume, is actually willing to do his job should he get it. We don&#039;t have to fear the prospect of Dan Taylor being swept to an easy victory because an apathetic student mass views the elections as boring, and we don&#039;t have to fear the election of a candidate whose incapability and lack of interest would be devastating, but whose judgmental attitude that he had stood despite those reasons &#039;for the good of students and democracy&#039; truly WOULD be a middle finger up to the university, and a further devaluation of YUSU. Hopefully, we don&#039;t even have to pay attention to him - he&#039;s stepped out of the contest before it has even begun (an action which would perhaps indicate that the otherwise self-satisfying Mr Taylor actually has some commitment to higher principles, were it not for his cryptic comments regarding his campaign against now departed Academic and Welfare Officer), and we can concentrate on the REAL candidates. We can, without needing to regard Dan Taylor, throw ourselves into the elections, allowing ourselves to be diverted by the amusing caperings of a clown candidate from what would otherwise promise to be as gloomy and uninspiring a contest as any student politics in recent years.</p>

<p>Critics one moment, mind readers another. How can you in your right mind claim one way or the other whether I ever intended standing. I had people nominate and second my form, I had 4 campaigners who had given me photos and I filled out the policy area of my form. To make such frankly unfounded and sweeping claims does, I am afraid, highlight your complete lack of intelligence and integrity. I would have stood had Matt Burton been uncontested. I happen to believe in student democracy and think that him being uncontested was bad for something I believe in. As soon as I understood he was contested which was when <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span> article came out about candidates, I withdrew and sent a message to <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> informing them of that decision. By all means, question what I believe in as I do with most people, but don&#039;t resort to attempting to read minds or make claims about what I did and did not intend to do because you are talking b****cks.</p>

<p>The question of whether I actually intended to run &#039;Mitch&#039; and whether or not this was all a publicity stunt. Your own quote above puts that to bed though.

<p>You really need to express yourself more clearly without room for ambiguity.</p>
<p>Although politicians have to learn to be as vague as possible whilst actually appearing to say things at the same time, you just seem to create misunderstandings. Had it been clear you were talking about the &quot;PR stunt&quot; allegation, then I wouldn&#039;t have bothered.</p>
<p>Anyway, I seem to be getting far too involved in a debate purely for the sake of it. I&#039;m out of here in 6 months - I don&#039;t really care who&#039;s running the union then, just as I haven&#039;t really cared for the past 3 years. All good banter though to distract me from my dissertation...</p>

<p>Perhaps he realised that having never sat on finance committee or indeed had anything to do with YUSU (apart from argue for disaffilation from NUS and slightly obsessivly fought to remove one if it&#039;s officers) he&#039;s vastly under-qualified. He even left before the end of the last UGM, which I have no doubt was the first he&#039;d ever attended.</p>
<p>Obviously, every student has a right to stand. But to be taken seriously as a candidate for a sabbatical position, you need to at least pretend to be interested in helping YUSU beforehand.</p>

<p>Maybe YUSU did need something like me in it.

Someone to give students the chance again to vote on NUS affiliation and someone to run sound finances, make savings and propose realistic ideas on a student bar ON campus, and not empty lies to sway students or unprofessional conduct at hustings.</p>
