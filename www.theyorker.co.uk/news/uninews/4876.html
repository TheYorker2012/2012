				No cash point in Goodricke			</div>
				<div class="Date">Tuesday, 25th May 2010</div>
		<div class="Author">

		</div>
		<div class="SubText">In response to the recent article in York Vision, Goodricke JCRC Campaigns Officer Andreas Gabrielsen spoke to the Yorker about his &ldquo;cash point struggles on Hes East&rdquo;.</div>

        <p>In his in-depth interview with us, Gabrielsen told <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span>, &ldquo;These began when I promised to actively campaign for improved infrastructure on Hes East when running for Goodricke JCRC Campaigns Officer, and made a cash point on Hes East a priority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gabrielsen began by discussing with college administration about plans and thoughts for a cashpoint. He then found out that apparently in neither Phase 1 nor 2 of Hes East&#039;s development was there a provision for a cash point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The closest we&#039;d come would be a &ldquo;cash back&rdquo; option in future catering facilities, which would not be open at all hours, nor be in place before quite some time,&rdquo; said Gabrielsen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also, this of course requires a purchase in the catering facilities for cash back in the first place,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>As a firm believer in the adage &quot;if you want something done, do it yourself&quot;, Gabrielsen set about trying to find a company that could provide Goodrickers with a cash point.</p>
<p>In his efforts, he came across Bank Machine ltd, a part of Cardtronics Inc, the world&rsquo;s largest provider of cash points, and proceeded to get in touch with a sales representative at the company, Julie Davison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has proven to be immensely helpful, understanding of our situation and patient with our struggle with bureaucracy,&rdquo; said Gabrielsen.</p>
<p>According to Gabrielsen, this company has provided &ldquo;free-to-use&rdquo; cash points to many other Universities such as Northumbria University, Newcastle, Christ Church Students Union, Canterbury and even York&rsquo;s neighbour, Leeds University.</p>
<p>Gabrielsen met with Davison to discuss the situation, including the number of students at present and the number of students over the next few years as the campus grows.</p>
<p>Davison agreed not only to provide Goodricke with a &quot;free-to-use&quot;, no-cost-to-the-university cash point, but also to waive the footfall of a minimum of 3,000 users monthly, which would in any case be a reality of Phase 1 of Hes East development, normally required. Instead, they agreed to install a cash point in the Goodricke Nucleus immediately for the convenience of the students currently residing in New Goodricke.</p>
<p>This followed as a result of a long series of meetings between Gabrielsen, the Goodricke administration and the company via Davison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spirits were high and everything was set for a cash point to be put in place during Easter holidays, with the blessing of both the company and the college,&rdquo; said Gabrielsen.</p>
<p>According to him, Commerical Services was the &ldquo;last hoop&rdquo; to jump through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that seemed at the time as just a final green light. They couldn&#039;t possibly be uninterested in the deal we were getting,&rdquo; added Gabrielsen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, during Easter I was proved disappointingly wrong,&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<p>Through Goodricke&rsquo;s Facilities Manager Mandy McKechnie, Goodricke JCRC Chair Tim Ellis was told that Commercial Services had &ldquo;apparently looked into&quot; their situation and &quot;disagreed, seemingly over contractual details&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This came much to my surprise, especially when it became known to me that Commercial Services hadn&#039;t even received the draft contract!&rdquo; said Gabrielsen.</p>
<p>Director of Commercial Services Jon Greenwood was reported in Vision saying, &quot;My own private research has found that private cash point providers look for a footfall of 5,000 people ... and of course charge for withdrawals.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These statements are, unfortunately, quite unfounded in truth,&rdquo; said Gabrielsen, pointing out that the details of the contract, which Davison provided him with, were quite the contrary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The footfall, as I&#039;ve already mentioned, is dealt with and sorted out with the company, and I made sure that Commercial Services was to be made aware of that,&rdquo; Gabrielsen told <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the charges, the contract states it will be free to operate and that all fees, withdrawal and general rent, will be an annual sum of a &ldquo;peppercorn&rdquo;, which is legal lingo for nominal amount. This includes the installation of the infrastructure necessary for a cash point, for example a landline, which was another objection raised by Greenwood&rsquo;s office,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>In response to the exclusivity clause in the contract raised by Commercial Services, Gabrielsen &ldquo;concedes&rdquo; that it presents a &ldquo;legit counterclaim to a cash point from this company&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, what is truly the problem with only having an ATM from Bank Machine ltd. on Hes East for the next five years, if there are no known or planned provisions for a different cash point in the immediate future?&rdquo; Gabrielsen demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would much rather have just Bank Machine ltd. cash points for five years, as long as they remain free to use and free for the University, than to have a two year guarantee of no cash point, followed by a potential how-many-years of uncertainty,&rdquo; said Gabrielsen.</p>
<p>Gabrielsen said his &ldquo;main disappointment&rdquo; was that his efforts &ldquo;seemed to be met with indifference on the part of Commercial Services&rdquo; and that, after his time and effort, the contract was not &ldquo;read through&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure, however, that Mr. Greenwood isn&#039;t an unreasonable man, and that when he gets the contract and gives it a thorough read, he will be more open for discussion with me,&rdquo; said Gabrielsen.</p>
<p>At present, Gabrielsen has sent Greenwood the contract through Ellis and is setting up a meeting with Greenwood and Ellis, &ldquo;hopefully next week&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If Commercial Services gives the green light on this effort, New Goodricke could very well be looking at getting a cash point within four weeks of notifying the company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was hoping to have provided this for all my fellow Goodrickers by now, but hopefully it will be here for college events and students in the near future,&rdquo; said Gabrielsen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So here&#039;s to hoping, pushing and never giving in on what students want and what students need.&rdquo;</p>
