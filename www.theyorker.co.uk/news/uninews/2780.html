<ul><li><strong>NUS Conference Delegates</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>The first candidate, <strong>Ali Allana</strong>, did not show up, so <strong>Michael Batula</strong> gave the first speech. Batula listed his experience, which includes being Alcuin College treasurer, Chair of Union Council, and one of the current Policy and Campaigns Officers, and said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m keen and enthusiastic, quite eager, maybe too eager to be part of the team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next up was <strong>Lewis Bretts</strong>, who said he was &ldquo;excited at the opportunity to represent my union on a national level&rdquo; and talked about learning more and building bridges by being an NUS delegate.</p>
<p>Bretts was followed by <strong>Daniel Carr</strong>, the current GSA President. Carr mentioned plans to merge the NUS and the National Postgraduate Committee and said: &ldquo;If the merger&rsquo;s done wrong, we&rsquo;ll get a raw deal.&rdquo; He added that he feels &ldquo;thrilled and absolutely obliged&rdquo; to get the chance to represent postgraduates at this year&rsquo;s Annual Conference.</p>
<p><strong>Rhianna Kinchin</strong> was next, who said she wanted to represent students and work with other unions on a national level, and promised to &ldquo;get our money&rsquo;s worth from the NUS&rdquo;.</p>
<p>After Kinchin was <strong>Tom Langrish</strong>, who noted that he&rsquo;s been to the Annual Conference twice before. He said the conference was full of &ldquo;bureaucratic BS&rdquo; but that he could cut through it, and added: &ldquo;The issues that get discussed at NUS Conference...are all areas which I have a passionate interest and a high level of knowledge in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Langrish was followed by <strong>Oliver Lester</strong>, the former Derwent Chair. In a short speech, Lester said: &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll be the voice for all the students and in addition I&rsquo;d blog and report it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next up was <strong>David Levene</strong>, the current Chair of the York Labour Club. Levene mentioned that he has been at every NUS Conference that&rsquo;s taken place during his time at university, and said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s now time for YUSU to get on with fighting for fairer fees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Levene&rsquo;s speech, <strong>Charlie Leyland</strong> came forward and said that her current position, YUSU Academic and Welfare Officer, would stand her &ldquo;in really good stead to represent your views at a national level&rdquo;. She added: &ldquo;I feel I&rsquo;ve got the right communication channels to consult the students and represent them accurately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The penultimate candidate was <strong>Kath Mildon</strong>, who said: &ldquo;The union spends a lot of money of its budget on the NUS membership, and we have to make the most of our voice within the national student movement.&rdquo; She went on to promote her diverse background, which includes being both an undergraduate and a postgraduate at the University of York and having lived abroad.</p>
<p><strong>Jamie Tyler</strong> was up last, and he said the Annual Conference is &ldquo;more about what you learn from other people than what you learn from the NUS&rdquo;. He expressed the belief that he has successfully implemented some of the things he&rsquo;s learned at previous NUS conferences.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Chair of Union Council</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>David Levene</strong>, running unopposed, said the position was an opportunity to be &ldquo;innovative and dynamic and creative&rdquo;. He added that there is &ldquo;scope for working with the campus media in terms of what officers are doing on a day to day basis&rdquo;. He also expressed the belief that as Chair, he could &ldquo;smooth over tensions&rdquo; where there was disagreement and &ldquo;make student politics less of a gladiatorial arena&rdquo;.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Entertainments Officer</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>The first officer candidates to give a speech were <strong>Sam Daniels</strong> and <strong>Suzi Ellis</strong>, who are running for Entertainments Officer unopposed. Daniels said &ldquo;we feel any event that brings students onto campus is a good event&rdquo;, and Ellis added that to encourage this, they would lobby the university for 3am licences.</p>
<p>Ellis also proposed &ldquo;good strong inter-college relationships&rdquo; to help events and promised that, if elected, she and her partner would work for more drinks deals. She then stressed the importance of non-alcoholic events, while Daniels pushed their experience as Alcuin Ents Reps during their first year.</p>
<p>During questions, Daniels and Ellis were asked about how they would solve the problem of the late-night opening of Courtyard disturbing residents. Daniels said that if elected, they would co-ordinate with the Welfare Committee to find a solution to this. The candidates were also asked to &ldquo;entertain us&rdquo;, and Ellis responded by dancing.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Environment and Ethics Officer</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>Next up were the unopposed joint candidates for Environment and Ethics Officer, first-years <strong>David Clarke</strong> and <strong>Jade Flahive-Gilbert</strong>. In his opening speech, Clarke said: &ldquo;It is an exciting time to be an Environment and Ethics Officer,&rdquo; and praised the work of current officers Joe Thwaites and John Nicholls.</p>
<p>He went on to say he and his running mate &ldquo;are absolutely committed to environment and ethics, and absolutely committed to improving life at the University of York&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In her speech, Flahive-Gilbert added: &ldquo;If elected, we plan to raise the profile of environment and ethics on campus.&rdquo; She said they would organise more events and socials, and expressed their commitment to the current ethical investment campaign.</p>
<p>She also said: &ldquo;Our ambition is for the University of York to build on its success and to set an example nationally as an environmentally friendly institution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked about the GSA&rsquo;s plans to set up their own Environment and Ethics Officer during questioning, Clarke expressed a willingness to work with graduates. The two were also asked &ldquo;duck or goose?&rdquo; Clarke said he preferred ducks, &ldquo;because the geese make an awful racket outside my window&quot;.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Campaigns Officer</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>After Clarke and Flahive-Gilbert were finished, <strong>Chris Etheridge</strong> and <strong>Jason Rose</strong> came forward to talk about their joint campaign to be elected Campaigns Officer. Etheridge began by mentioning the Vanbrugh-Goodricke bridge, which has yet to be repaired.</p>
<p>He also brought up York Sport membership, helping college bars to compete with The Courtyard and getting cashpoints in Alcuin and Derwent. He then went on to discuss the NUS&rsquo;s Broke and Broken campaign, which opposes raising the tuition fee cap.</p>
<p>Rose began his speech by listing all the campaigns YUSU are currently mandated to support, and showed how many there are. He said: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot on our plate already, and we&rsquo;re going to follow through with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked about their key campaigns, Etheridge and Rose chose the Broke and Broken campaign, the bridge and sports centre prices. They were also asked about Heslington East, and Etheridge announced that they had plans to meet Vice-Chancellor Brian Cantor and Pro-Vice Chancellor for Students Jane Grenville to discuss the problems with the new site.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Sports President</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>After a short break, the five candidates for Sports President took the stage. As they made their way to the front, a group of very vocal <strong>Michael Sneddon</strong> supporters chanted &ldquo;there&rsquo;s only one Michael Sneddon&rdquo; and that they were &ldquo;walking in a Sneddon wonderland&rdquo;.</p>
<p>First to speak was <strong>Gemma Johnson</strong>. The current York Sport Tournament Secretary admitted that there were flaws in the current sport system, and said &ldquo;they need to be sorted out&rdquo;.</p>
<p>She went on to discuss her three key objectives: enhancing sport facilities, lowering the membership fee, and improving funding, facilities and opportunities. She finished by saying: &ldquo;I honestly believe I&rsquo;m the best person for the role.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Second was <strong>Michael &#039;Stash&#039; Leahy</strong>. Leahy, who is currently York Sport Treasurer, said he has &ldquo;tons of experience&rdquo; and added: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m totally committed to the causes of sport at York, and I&rsquo;m also totally committed to supporting the interests of sport at York. I&rsquo;m going to bring passion and excellence to the role.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then listed his policies, which include providing better value for money, improving college sport, increasing sponsorship and putting together more sports beginners&rsquo; classes.</p>
<p>Leahy was followed by <strong>Kath Mildon</strong>, who hailed herself &ldquo;Viking Kat&rdquo;. Mildon said, &ldquo;I want to be York Sport President because I think the focus of the organisation has to change. At the moment, there&rsquo;s too much focus on university sport and not enough on inclusion, health and fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She also criticised the York Sport website, saying it was in need of improvement, and proposed a fruit caf&eacute; in the Sports Centre.</p>
<p>Next up was <strong>Emily Scott</strong>, presenter of YSTV&rsquo;s York Sport Show. Emily Scott pushed her past experience, noting that she had been elected Halifax Sports Rep for three years running. She went on to say that she wants to establish better connections with the sports clubs and strengthen the links with campus media.</p>
<p>She also stressed the importance of college sports, and promised to bring back Varsity next year. She finished by saying: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hard working and 100 percent committed to further sport at York anywhere I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, Michael Sneddon gave his speech. He said that his work in the media has led to sports presidents coming to him with their problems and then admitted: &ldquo;As far as sports go, I&rsquo;m not very good at sport, but I really like to get involved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Policies mentioned included improving the university&rsquo;s BUCS ranking, ensuring no more sports matches were forfeited and arranging a twice-termly meeting with the sports clubs. He tried to finish on a quote from Eric Cantona but was cut off as his time was up, and his supporters voiced their disapproval to the annoyance of co-host Tom Scott.</p>
<p>The audience submitted a number of questions to ask the students. They were first asked about current Sports President Alex Lacy&rsquo;s proposal to have all sports teams wear matching kits. Johnson, Laehy and Emily Scott said they approved, whilst Mildon said it was &ldquo;an unnecessary burden&rdquo; and Sneddon highlighted the problems that could arise.</p>
<p>One of the more controversial questions put forward was &ldquo;If you were Alex Lacy, what would you have done differently?&rdquo; Johnson apologetically said he should have consulted more clubs about his proposals, and Laehy agreed that consultation needed more thought. Mildon also emphasised the need for better communication, whilst Emily Scott highlighted the failure of Lacy&rsquo;s club forum. Sneddon joked: &ldquo;Alex Lacy? I&rsquo;ve only got a minute, I&rsquo;ll move on.&rdquo;</p>

<ul><li><strong>Student Activities Officer</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>Current YUSU Training Officer <strong>Rhianna Kinchin</strong> began the speeches for Student Activities Officer, bringing a box of Special K with her. She opened by saying: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve proven in the past year I will work hard for this union, I&rsquo;ve been involved in student activities for three years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went on to promote interaction between student activities, including York Sport as a RAG beneficiary, hosting a student activities award night and putting together an international societies forum. She also talked about expanding YUSU fair and finding a &ldquo;long term fix&rdquo; to save Kids Camp.</p>
<p>The second candidate, <strong>Ella-Grace Kirton</strong>, promoted herself as &ldquo;not your traditional candidate,&rdquo; admitting that she has never been a YUSU Officer or held a position on her JCRC. She did, however, emphasise that she has immersed herself in a number of student activities, including Student Action, People and Planet and York Labour Club.</p>
<p>She promised a &ldquo;fresh perspective,&rdquo; and said if elected she would attend at least two society meetings every week. She added that she wanted two society meetings every term and to give RAG and Student Action greater support.</p>
<p>Last but not least was <strong>Rory Shanks</strong>, the current YUSU Societies and Communications Officer. Regarding this new position, he said: &ldquo;I think the new role of Student Activities is going to be rather uncertain, and needs someone that has the drive to take things forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added that he would ensure this new position was not detrimental to societies, RAG or Student Action. He also pushed strongly for a Student Activities Office, saying, &ldquo;we need to establish an open office that&rsquo;s full of staff.&rdquo; He also talked about invigorating the college system, setting up a Justgiving page for YUSU, saving Kids Camp and breaking a world record to raise money for RAG.</p>
<p>During question time, the three candidates were asked about the media charter. Shanks said it was &ldquo;important and necessary,&rdquo; but should only be used to prevent libel. Kinchin said it needed updating and that media training should be provided. Kirton said it protects YUSU and protects welfare.</p>
<p>The issues surrounding Kids Camp were also raised again during questioning. Candidates were asked: &ldquo;Kids Camp is only one of 14 Student Action projects. How do you plan to support the other 13?&rdquo; Kirton stressed that Kids Camp was important and &ldquo;needs to keep on running,&rdquo; but added that the other projects offer &ldquo;different, just as valuable things&rdquo; and should also be supported.</p>
<p>Shanks reiterated that Kids Camp &ldquo;must continue,&rdquo; and said that YUSU Fair could be used to support the other Student Action projects. Kinchin added: &ldquo;We have to continue Kids Camp. It&rsquo;s valuable to the volunteers, it&rsquo;s valuable to the kids, it would be a massive loss.&rdquo;</p>

<ul><li><strong>Democracy and Services</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>The final speeches of the night were provided by the four Democracy and Services candidates &ndash; <strong>Lewis Bretts</strong>, <strong>Ed Durkin</strong>, <strong>George Papadofragakis</strong> and <strong>David Sharp</strong>.</p>
<p>Bretts began by listing his experience, particularly emphasising the things he&rsquo;s done outside of the university. Regarding these, he said: &ldquo;Working out in the commercial world is very different from working for YUSU. My professional experience has made me the kind of person that gets things done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also said that &ldquo;YUSU should spend less time talking and more time doing.&rdquo; He mentioned a number of policies, including temporary ATMs during Freshers&rsquo; Week, a weekly minibus service from campus to Morrisons, and working with JCRCs to improve college bars. He also promised to hold regular office drop-in days and said &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll even make you a sandwich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Durkin, one of the current YUSU Entertainments Officers, said that &ldquo;the commercial capacity of the union has just gone through the roof,&rdquo; and put forward a number of policies that would build on this. He proposed setting up a campus take-away from The Courtyard, bringing in a 24 hour DVD rental scheme, and sorting out a bike rental service on campus.</p>
<p>He also talked about bring more live music to York, setting up a bakery stall in Your:Shop and providing free FTR buses between the two campuses when the first Heslington East buildings are completed.</p>
<p>The third candidate to speak was George Papadofragakis, the current ISA Welfare Officer. He said he was running &ldquo;because, quite frankly, there&rsquo;s an elephant in this room...students do not really care about student politics.&rdquo; He said that 60 percent of students feel misrepresented and 15 percent do not know that they have a vote, and proposed methods to improve this.</p>
<p>He suggested, amongst other things, encouraging involvement in UGMs to increase turnout, and following up motions when they become active policy. He also discussed improving student letting from external agencies, such as Sinclair Properties.</p>
<p>Last up was David Sharp, the former Halifax President, whose supporters gave him a reception to rival Sneddon&rsquo;s. Sharp said he was running because &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel YUSU has been serving its students sufficiently.&rdquo; He added: &ldquo;YUSU has been acting far too much like a business, we need to bring the power back to students.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sharp proposed letting bar-less colleges use The Courtyard for events, and changing the Quids Inn night to Sunday night to help campus events. He made several more suggestions, including bringing YUSU closer to Commercial Services and setting up a bi-termly book stall. He promoted his link to Halifax, stating: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m college based, I&rsquo;m not from YUSU.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Questions for candidates began with asking them about the collegiate system. Durkin said the college system should be strengthened, and agreed with Sharp&rsquo;s policy to change the night Quids Inn is run.</p>
<p>Papadofragakis also supported the collegiate system, saying: &ldquo;The way that this student union works is pretty much fundamentally based on colleges.&rdquo; Sharp proposed more joint-college events, and again claimed that The Courtyard is ruining college events. Bretts said that colleges should have greater autonomy, but with more support from YUSU.</p>
<p>Candidates were also asked about their policy on Sinclairs advertising through YUSU. Bretts suggested delaying the timing of signing letting agreements, so that students have more time to make decisions. Durkin brought up the impending UGM motion on Sinclairs, and said he would support whatever decision the students voted for.</p>
<p>Papadofragakis said he would take a firm stance against not just Sinclairs, but any letting agency that refuses to sign the code of best practice. Sharp suggested improving the housing website &ldquo;to promote other housing companies, not just Sinclairs&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The evening ended on a lighter note, with the final question of the night asking candidates &ldquo;what size are your boots?&rdquo; Sharp and Bretts are both size 12, Durkin is a size 11, and Papadofragakis only knows his European size.</p>
<p>As for who will fill the boots of the current YUSU Officers, only time will tell. Last night, the unopposed candidates were all impressive enough to justify being elected, and none of the candidates in the contested positions looked out of their depth or incompetent.</p>

<p>I think that the criticisms of George speaking quickly were really criticisms of the fact that he used good rhetoric and had a lot to say. Most candidates did well but George was the best!</p>

<ul id="CommentItem6044History" class="comment_edit"><li>Wed, 4th Mar 2009 12:26pm - Edited by the author</li></ul><p>I agree that the criticism of George speaking too fast is a little harsh.  Whilst I support one of the other candidates for this position, I actually thought some of the answers George gave were fantastic, especially regarding Sinclair Properties.  If you actually listened to ideas rather than just who shouted loudest or had the biggest support section present, I think George would have to come across well last night.</p>

<p>Personally, I think all candidates did well, but Lewis Brett&#039;s speech seemed to have just that bit more energy and passion in it.</p>

<p>I think you mean Lewis Bretts&#039; - he&#039;s answered that point previously.</p>
<p>Anywho, I think that candidates fared well in different ways. Some candidates were strong on some questions and weak on others.... regardless I feel that it is unfair to pick on someone for saying MORE than other candidates!</p>

<p>Emily Scott wasn&#039;t elected to Halifax 3 years running. In 2007 she asked join the Sports Rep team just after Leigh Kroeger was no confidenced.... just in time to help claim the trophy. Very democratic.</p>

<p>#8, they will be on the YSTV and Nouse websites eventually, but there are only so many hours in the day and only so many PCs in the YSTV office we made the decision to prioritise sabbs.</p>
