		<div class="SubText">The Yorker talks to the candidates for Democracy and Services - Lewis Bretts, Edward Durkin, George Papadofragakis and David Sharp.</div>

        
<ul><li><strong>What relevant experience do you have for the position?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Lewis Bretts:</strong> I&#039;ve been a YUSU Ents Assistant, Derwent Ents Rep, and I&#039;m a Union Council Member. I&#039;ve stage managed Woodstock, Summerball, Rag Parade &amp; Battle of the Bands, and was the Responsible Person (Event Manager) for the last Summerball. More importantly though, I&#039;ve been working professionally in events management for the past four years including the Reading, Leeds &amp; Latitude Festivals, and that&#039;s given me experience of what life is like in the real world, and has made me frustrated with the bureaucracy that seems to engulf the university and even YUSU at times.</p>
<p><strong>Edward Durkin:</strong> As the current Entertainments Officer for the Student Union I have worked closely with the Services &amp; Finance Officer on projects including The Courtyard, and have had a key role in the organisation of Freshers Ball, Summer Ball, Access All Areas, and three Viking Raids. My role also includes the coordination of all campus events, which has meant developing a detailed knowledge of college events.</p>
<p>I have been heavily involved in the collegiate system since I arrived at university, becoming an Ents rep in my first year and subsequently being elected Vice Chair Business &amp; Services of Alcuin College. Here I gained vast experience organising the College&rsquo;s 40th anniversary, coordinating the
&lsquo;There is a Plan B&rsquo; campaign, and overseeing all Freshers Week events.</p>
<p>Societies-wise I sat on the Fusion committee last year as Sponsorship &amp; Advertising Officer. This was a hugely rewarding position, and one that I thoroughly enjoyed, contacting external companies to secure over &pound;1,500 for
the show. I was also the Vice Chair of Platinum society, helping to oversee accounts, and organising music events off campus.</p>
<p>All in all I have directly worked on over six major events, including &lsquo;RPing&rsquo; Woodstock and 15 Late licenses over two Freshers Weeks. The experience that I have gained over the last couple of years will be invaluable to the position of Democracy &amp; Services. I am very aware of the capabilities of the Union, and the mix of policies improving current Union services and introducing new ones is a reflection of this.</p>
<p><strong>George Papadofragakis:</strong> I am currently the Welfare officer for the International Students&#039; Association, I&#039;ve been in the ISA executive committee for the last year and I have helped manage a large budget and organise International Week, Fiesta, Unwind, Unreel - YUSU/ISA Fresher events - and many other events. I am also a member of YUSU&#039;s Welfare Committee and I&#039;ve been through YUSU training. Additionally,
I am a committee member for the debating society, I have represented York in the Oxford Union debating tournament and I have helped organise York&#039;s very first debating tournament with representatives from 30 universities. I was also among the main organisers of &#039;Humanitarian aid for Gaza&#039;, helping raise over &pound;2500 for that cause, and I was involved in organising the ethical investment campaign. Finally, I chair a non-partisan political society on campus and I am doing a bachelor of engineering degree.</p>
<p><strong>David Sharp:</strong> I believe I have a very good understanding of what the students at this uni want, I was Halifax president last year so my back ground is college based rather than purely YUSU based. I have also sat on Union Council and various other committees such as Bar Strategy. This gives me both the experience in YUSU and outside. However, I am keen to promote change within YUSU as I really do not feel they have served their students sufficiently. I have also organised many events for Halifax including both the Summer ball and Christmas ball as well as being a bar officer for my first year where I put on events such as the bar quiz and &#039;Fax off to Leeds&#039;. Finally I also acted as returning officer in the latest Halifax college elections as well as running the Golf Club&#039;s elections when I was captain.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Why are you running for this position?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>LB:</strong> Because the Students Union has a massive impact on all of our lives at York, and I really want to make students&#039; lives easier by ensuring that the union provides more simple services that we&#039;ll all use.</p>
<p><strong>ED:</strong> It actually took a while for me to decide whether to run or not. It&rsquo;s obvious that the next year is huge for the Union and the university, with the great success of The Courtyard and the expansion to Hes East next year the potential for all involved is huge. My final decision was made when I sat down and thought about my policies. I realised that with my ideas and the relevant experience to be able to implement them, it would be a very exciting year. Long term plans such as the bike scheme that I want to introduce, coupled with immediate one&rsquo;s such as Subway in Market Square mean that I would be able to improve the experience for students on campus and
around the university as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>GP:</strong> Good question, it is after all common knowledge that for most students this is little more than an annual popularity contest. In truth, I am running because I believe that it is high time we address student disenchantment. I believe that the only way we can do that is by trying to open up YUSU, by putting ideals back on the table and by encouraging meaningful participation. I am running for this position because I believe that being a &#039;Democracy and Services&#039; officer is not about being a full-time ents and services rep who just so happens to be responsible for the democratic process within the Union. The occupant of this position should be focusing on how we can realistically improve student services while at the same time making this Union less like a
medieval monarchy and more like an open student democracy. This is why I am running and this is why I hope I will earn your support.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> I am running for Democracy and Services because i feel YUSU has been neglecting the needs of its students and that the power needs to be brought back to the students and colleges, because after all you are the people YUSU are here to help. I really feel that YUSU has been far too business
orientated and needs to realise that money isn&#039;t everything and that support and services to students are more important. I think that I am the person to bring such change - why elect another YUSU-based candidate who does not have the same passion to change YUSU&#039;s attitude for the better?</p>

<ul><li><strong>Why should students vote for you?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>LB: </strong> Because I&#039;ve got the knowledge and experience that the Democracy &amp; Services Officer needs, the no-nonsense attitude that will actually get things done, and policies that will have a real, noticeable impact on students&#039; lives.</p>
<p><strong>ED:</strong> I would hope that people are excited by the prospect of things I want to introduce onto campus. I know when I talk to people they agree on the same issues; there is not enough live music on campus, Market Square is underutilised, Goodricke students need a huge amount of support on the new campus, the voting system is over complicated, the list goes on. All these are things that I want to combat in the next year and I have innovative and completely feasible ways of getting them done. If people want a Union that will tackle these issues, with the security of having someone with experience taking them on, then they should vote for me.</p>
<p><strong>GP:</strong> I believe that my candidacy is the one that best reflects the new responsibilities of this position. There is a solid reason why this is no longer &#039;Services and Finance&#039; but rather &#039;Democracy and Services&#039;. YUSU now has a manager dealing with financial issues and administrating its commercial services. On the other hand, it is now up to the Democracy and Services officer to try to reconcile this Union
with its members and work towards a more direct and functional student democracy. I believe that my proposals on how we can open up the student union, improve its services and encourage student participation can get us a long way down that path. Before you make your choice, I strongly encourage you to read through all of our policies - if you believe that I can positively represent you, then I would welcome your support.</p>
<p><strong>DS: </strong> I believe students should vote for me because I am really passionate about what I would like to see change, I am in this to make the student experience better and provide better services and facilities to students. I honestly believe that I am the best person for the job and am endeavouring to suggest much needed but at the same time realistic policies.</p>

<ul><li><strong>What is the best thing that you have done at university?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>LB:</strong> I don&#039;t know, probably just having punch with friends, but I&#039;m going to say Slag and Drag in my first year!</p>
<p><strong>ED:</strong> Watching the final act at Summer Ball last year. Seeing so many people enjoy an event that you&rsquo;ve put so much work into gives you a huge sense of accomplishment, and you remember why you decided to do it all in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>GP:</strong> Undoubtedly, organising &#039;Humanitarian aid for Gaza&#039; - the walk to Selby that united so many people from such different backgrounds in an attempt to raise funds for the victims of a clear humanitarian catastrophe. I think it would be unfair on my part not to thank all the other organisers: Christopher Etheridge, David Levene, Jason Rose and John Nicholls. And of course, each of the 53 students who walked those 20 miles with us and all those who made it all worthwhile by donating so much to that cause.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> Welcome Week, I was heavily involved in the running of this year&#039;s Welcome Week and it was one of the more rewarding things I have done, it was great knowing that you had organised something that really did make the new students feel welcome and realise what a fantastic university this really is.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Guilty Pleasure?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>LB:</strong> A too large a glass of nice whisky at the end of a long day.</p>
<p><strong>ED:</strong> The Hills&rsquo; on MTV... I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>GP:</strong> Strip Scrabble.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> It&#039;s got to be <em>High School Musical</em>, I love each and every one and am trying to sort out a HSM marathon with my house mates.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Most Treasured Possession?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>LB:</strong> Easy: My Macbook or iPhone!</p>
<p><strong>ED:</strong> The ticket stub from my first ever Tottenham game. We drew 2-2 at home to Birmingham City, they scored in the last minute. It was heartbreaking.</p>
<p><strong>GP:</strong> My Cashmere coat, for various reasons.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> Probably my golf clubs, at heart I really am a golf geek and don&#039;t know what id do if I didn&#039;t have my clubs</p>

<ul><li><strong>Favourite Book?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>LB:</strong> <em>The Colour Purple</em></p>
<p><strong>ED:</strong>  <em>The trans-Siberian express: A traveller&rsquo;s anthology</em></p>
<p><strong>GP:</strong> <em>Christ Recrucified</em> by Nikos Kazatzakis and <em>Il Gattopardo</em> by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa. That was probably cheating but I can&#039;t pick.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> It&#039;s either <em>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</em> or <em>Prey</em> by Michael Crichton... I&#039;m going to go for <em>Prey</em>.</p>

<ul><li><strong>If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>LB:</strong> Invisibility, easily the most versatile and useful of all of the superpowers!</p>
<p><strong>ED:</strong> I would like to be able to fly.</p>
<p><strong>GP:</strong> Patience.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> I think to fly, I used to go flying when I was in the CCF and is something id love to do again.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Do you have a favourite Thunderbirds character?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>LB:</strong> Hmmm, I&#039;m not sure, probably Parker!</p>
<p><strong>ED:</strong> Definitely Parker</p>
<p><strong>GP:</strong> Not really.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> I reckon Virgil. For one he gets to fly my favourite aircraft Thunderbird 2, and he also is one of the braver characters and is always calm and collected.</p>

<p>did not realise opening a subway franchise was not a long term project, as it would likely be there for quite a while? or that it was immediate, seems like it would take a while to get it one set up?</p>

<p>&quot;yes only george has campaigned for the position that&#039;s up. the rest would have been better last year&quot;</p>
<p>I feel that&#039;s a little unfair: keeping my manifesto available all year; making weekly video blogs &amp; making video footage of UGM&#039;s available are all in my &#039;top 8&#039; policies.</p>
<p>I&#039;ve also pledged to release public monthly accounts, provide dedicated funding to increase participation in JCRC elections, and my drop in days are aimed at increasing approachability.</p>
<p>I know the services side of things seems to have been picked up by people a bit more. But I think that&#039;s more because the accountability/democracy element of YUSU hasn&#039;t been pushed so much in the past, so people aren&#039;t so aware of how important these things are.</p>
