		<div class="SubText">The Yorker interviews the two pairs of candidates running for LGBT Officer - James Ball and Mandi Madavo, and Peter Medley and Elanin Vince.</div>

        
<ul><li><strong>Relevant experience?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>James Ball &amp; Mandi Madavo:</strong> We&#039;re both Derwent JCRC reps and Mandi is LGBT Social Vice Chair...we know we don&#039;t technically have a lot of experience but what we lack in experience we more than make up for in drive, determination and sensible policies.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Medley:</strong> I joined LGBT Social back in my first term at York and found it an oversexualised gay men&#039;s club. I became treasurer, and myself and the secretary at the time worked towards encouraging the committee to put on a more balanced timetable of events - loud and quiet, club nights and campus nights - and pulling in more people.</p>
<p>A term later, our Chair stood down and I took up his position which I now hold with a co-chair. Whilst chairing this committee, I have also been an active member of YUSU LGBT - which co-ordinates welfare and campaigns for LGBT people - and worked closely with them to ensure that our events were open to all and that the LGBT community was well provided for with both fun and support whenever and wherever they should need it. Myself, Ben and Sarah are part of the group that has helped to make LGBT at York what it is today - it&#039;s not perfect yet, but it has come a long way.</p>
<p>On these two committees, I&#039;ve been heavily involved with big campaigns like Sex &amp; Sexuality week and Love Without Borders and have worked on important or big events like Icebreakers and Boot Camp. But I have more than just admin and organisational experience having been Langwith&#039;s LGBT rep last year and welfare rep this year. I have supported people during the transitional but terrifying time of coming out both as a friend and as a member of YUSU LGBT, and have had to handle some more complicated situations involving both physical and emotional abuse. I&#039;m used to putting the time aside for those who need it.</p>
<p><strong>Elanin Vince:</strong> Well, I&#039;ve been involved with LGBT at York since my first year. I started out attending a few social events and got to know a few people, and then Peter suggested I run with him for Langwith LGBT Rep. I was really nervous, but I jumped at the chance to get involved. I&#039;m now in my second term of office as Langwith&#039;s LGBT Rep, and still loving it. Peter moved on from LGBT to general Welfare Rep, and he does the job brilliantly. As a result of being involved with Langwith as LGBT Rep, I&#039;ve been working on YUSU LGBT and with Ben and Sarah for over a year. This year, I got involved with LGBT Social as a committee member - last term I graduated from Ordinary Member to Secretary. It&#039;s a lot of running around, chasing people up and writing, but I love it and I&#039;ve become super involved as a result of hard graft and dedication.</p>
<p>In terms of &#039;real&#039; experience, rather than just positions and qualifications, I&#039;ve dealt with a ton of really difficult welfare situations, organised some tricky events (big and small!) and I&#039;m very, very used to co-ordination and administration. I worked in admin during my gap year and the company has kept me on for holiday work while I am at uni. I also worked with youth groups before I came to university and I met some real characters and learned a lot about people in general.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Why are you running?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>JB &amp; MM:</strong> We&#039;re running in order to represent change and fresh ideas - to put as much of ourselves into the betterment of the committee as we have gotten out of it. We feel that there are still some problems in the committee, which is why we&#039;re advocating a rebalance of responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> We&#039;re running for many reasons. We&#039;re running because having worked on YUSU LGBT for over a year now we know what hasn&#039;t been achieved yet and what needs the most work. We&#039;re running because having been as involved as we are, we think we can help YUSU LGBT achieve those things. Most of all, we&#039;re running for what is invisible: maintaining an effective welfare network. Ben and Sarah will leave quite a legacy, and we think we&#039;re well placed to continue making sure that help reaches those who need it, whoever they are and however that may be. I&#039;m running because Elanin and I working together are the best people for the job.</p>
<p><strong>EV:</strong> We&#039;re running because we really care that YUSU LGBT works for the students it represents and works with them. We love what Ben and Sarah have done, but we see places where it could be improved. For example, we feel we need to step up publicity, get greater exposure for LGBT and work on improving people&#039;s perceptions and preconceptions of what LGBT people are like, and increase inclusivity and accessibility. We&#039;ve thrown ourselves into the deep end with YUSU LGBT, having to learn on the job and learn fast, and we&#039;ve put in so much hard work that we feel we can step up to the task. We know what we want to do, we&#039;re open minded and interested in what other people have to say, and more than anything else, we are ready for this role. It would have seemed absurd to not hand in that nomination form!</p>

<ul><li><strong>Why should students vote for you?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>JB &amp; MM:</strong> We offer to students a serious alternative to the status quo. We represent a different mindset: fairness, and down-to-earth common sense.</p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> Students should vote for us because we&#039;ve researched our policies thoroughly, not only in recent weeks but over the past year with our involvement in YUSU LGBT. They should vote for us because we&#039;ve researched the position thoroughly, by getting involved and working closely with the current team and by asking them what they have achieved and what they haven&#039;t and by discussing with them what still needs to change. They should vote for us because we&#039;ve worked at many levels on committees and been involved with big events and campaigns and know how to work with people and forms to get the job done. Students should vote for us because we know what it is to give up your time when someone needs support; we&#039;re used to it, and we&#039;re ready for the responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>EV:</strong> We are absolutely dedicated. We are very experienced. We&#039;re used to stress, setbacks and disappointment, and we know how to rally around and make something good out of it. We know what the job entails and we&#039;re realistic about what we need to do and what we can bring to the role. We are caring, passionate and approachable. Finally, as I said before, we are ready for this role.</p>

<ul><li><strong>The best thing I&#039;ve done at uni is...</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>JB:</strong> Being in Operagasmic&#039;s production of The Marriage of Figaro was a great experience; looking at an old show with fresh eyes.</p>
<p><strong>MM:</strong> Love Without Borders Week was fun and informative. I relished the opportunity to talk at the &#039;Can We Love Without Borders?&#039; event; it was great to talk about my home country Zimbabwe, and to highlight the social problems there.&#039;</p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> Without doubt being part of making LGBT what it is today. I receive the criticisms that LGBT Social runs too many club nights and too many quiet events in equal measure, which I take as proof that we have the balance as close as we can get it to perfect. We have a social society with lesbians and gays and bisexuals and trans people! This shouldn&#039;t sound shocking for an LGBT society, but that&#039;s not always been the case. The job is not complete, but York has a fun and friendly LGBT community which is always there for people in need, and I&#039;ve been a foundational part of that.</p>
<p><strong>EV:</strong> Getting involved with LGBT. I did say I was dedicated! Between that and my degree, I&#039;ve not had time for anything else. I&#039;m not upset though - I love my jobs with LGBT and I really wouldn&#039;t want to be doing anything else... except maybe training to be a helicopter pilot. Even then I&#039;d make the time to organise some events and have a chat with someone in need!</p>

<ul><li><strong>Guilty Pleasure?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>JB:</strong> Haha I have to confess: I love musicals. It&#039;s possibly the only gay stereotype I adhere to, but I can&#039;t help it!</p>
<p><strong>MM:</strong> &rsquo;N Sync! It&#039;s been a long and tumultuous love affair...</p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> After a long or stressful day, I sometimes stay up and sit in bed watching rubbish telly on my laptop, eating large bars of chocolate and drinking juice from the carton. Everyone has to unwind sometimes!</p>
<p><strong>EV:</strong> Computer games! Wonderfully geeky and so much fun. I&#039;m a little addicted to Guitar Hero at the moment.</p>
