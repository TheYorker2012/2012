		<div class="SubText">YUSU President Tom Scott has denied rumours that he is to step down from his post.</div>

        <p>Sources within YUSU had expressed the opinion that Tom Scott was growing increasingly frustrated with the job and was planning on relinquishing the post he took on back in July. One went as far as predicting he would be gone by Christmas.</p>
<p>When contacted about whether he was intending to quit, his reply was simply: &quot;Hahaha. No.&quot; He declined to comment any further on the rumours.</p>
<p>Tom Scott was a controversial winner at last year&#039;s elections, having run his campaign as pirate Mad Cap&#039;n Tom. The result was especially surprising since his involvement with YUSU politics had been limited up to that point.</p>
<p>Despite his initial claims that he would remain Mad Cap&#039;n Tom throughout his time as YUSU president, <a href="../2019/21.html">he has since decided</a> to only use it for special occasions.</p>
<p>After the elections <a href="../1598.html">he admitted</a> he hadn&#039;t wanted the job in the first place but believed he could do a good job and would do his best, having been voted in.</p>

<p>lol, as I said. Apologies to those who informed me that this story would be the opposite for laughing behind their back.</p>
<p>He&#039;s a man of his word... even if he hated it I would doubt that he&#039;d put himself above the average student, and I also doubt that he hates his job enough to really contemplate it at present.</p>
<p>Good work by him so far this year though - keep it up, Cap&#039;n!</p>

<p>Why would he quit? By all accounts from those in the know he does precious little work, and picks up a reasonable salary for sitting around and occassionally dressing up as a pirate...</p>

<ul id="CommentItem4532History" class="comment_edit"><li>Mon, 17th Nov 2008 11:01am - Edited by the author</li></ul><p>Chris, quote from someone on the AU Exec.:</p>
<p>&quot;Never have I seen anyone look so busy and get so little done&quot;.</p>
<p>I didn&#039;t post comment #4 but there is certainly evidence from those surrounding Scott that he does very little.</p>
<p>Another accusation is that he spends much of his day doing mentally stimulating puzzles. All accusations, but nevertheless, accusations by people who are &#039;in the know&#039; and about Scott on a daily basis.</p>
<p>I have also heard that his input on exec. committee is mimimal and infact Matt Burton ends up &#039;Chairing&#039; the discussion, adding far more to the discussion than the President himself.</p>
<p>I do not experience this on a daily basis, so I am obviously unsure who to believe and what to believe. There is howevever, rarely smoke without fire, and having heard that two YUSU Sabs. have hinted that they may like him to resign, frankly due to lazyness, as well as quotes from others in the YUSU &#039;bubble&#039;, it appears he is slacking in his responsibilities not just to his collegues but to his students.</p>
<p>As many said at the time, YUSU President is not a position one &#039;has a go at&#039;. It is a serious, paid job (as #4 alludes to) and not a joke. Not something you do &#039;for fun&#039; and it would appear increasingly obvious that Scott is not fulfilling his mandate to the students.</p>

<p>&quot;There is howevever, rarely smoke without fire&quot;</p>
<p>I beg to differ as you appear to be a quite frankly smoke machine. It was you that posted &quot;I have also heard rumours that Tom Scott is considering resigning. True.&quot; in the article about the statement from <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span> Directors which unfortunately seems to have led to this pointless pursuit for Tom Scott&#039;s opinion on the matter. I can&#039;t think of one way in which he has failed York students, I think he is exactly what the Union needs - a breath of fresh air and not part of the YUSU clique (which I can&#039;t help thinking is only exaggerated by having somebody in the same position for two years running!)</p>
<p>YUSU President is a serious, paid job. And one he is doing perfectly well.</p>

<p>Sir Dan:</p>
<p>I accept the point that if many people are talking about something there is probably more to this than just pure rumours. But are alot of people saying this?</p>
<p>I also reckon that it is equally true that people tend to see what they want to see, that people like to criticise the higher ups and that once some rumors that really are just rumours pick up intertia they really cascade.</p>
<p>&quot;Never have I seen anyone look so busy and get so little done&quot;</p>
<p>Is obviously quite an epic commment, also obviously an exageration. I dont really buy into something that someone on the same team as TS says when its so unconstructive. Im not saying that I dont think that someone might have said so (I dont know if you heard it directly from this person). Surely if there was much truth to it this someone should go and have a chat with TS himself and not just go talking behind his back? It doesent really sound like a accurate description, more like an epic statement. You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Also, that MB speaks alot, that is just good practice surely? He must be the one with most inside experience around... listenting to better informed people must be key to sorting something as big as YUSU out...</p>

<p>#6 No offence to anyone on the AU Exec, I know they do a lot of work. But they aren&#039;t exactly &quot;in the know&quot; or close to the YUSU President. A member of AU Exec will see a lot of the AU Pres, and be in a good place to comment on the effectiveness of the work that they do, but in no place at all to talk about the YUSU Pres, or any of the other sabbs.</p>
<p>Most of the work the YUSU President does is in boring meetings with the university that students don&#039;t see much of, but which can make a big difference to the student experience. Same goes for Ac&amp;Welfare. They also spend a lot of time reading through university documents and preparing for these meetings so that they&#039;re best placed to make students&#039; views heard.</p>

<p>I&#039;m disappointed by the complete lack of effort by <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> in this case. The only question asked of Tom Scott was whether he intends to quit, and no comments have been sought from other people (why not pressure Mr Taylor on his sources, for example?)</p>
<p>All the article does is open up another space for people to post speculative and sensationalist comments on.</p>

<p>I think you&#039;ll find that Dom asked Tom more than whether or not he intended to quit, but given <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>&#039;s current relationship with YUSU Tom&#039;s only response was &quot;hahahahaha no&quot;. He wasn&#039;t willing to say any more, just wanted to stop potential speculation.</p>

<p>Eleanor, you might be a great personal friend of Tom, but I doubt you have to work side-by-side with him on a daily basis. I am sure he appreciates your support but it is clear that his colleagues are not entirely happy with the contribution he is making.</p>
<p>You are correct in saying I knew about this story about a week ago because I happen to speak to people in YUSU/on the AU and attempt in some way to hold our elected representative to account; see how they&#039;re doing and what they are contributing to representing us on issues that matter. From my correspondance with more than 3 people from the AU and SU, there is a feeling that Tom, contrary to what you say, is not fulfilling his mandate to his colleagues or to the students he represents.</p>
<p>#13 and #15, I think your points are linked. Tom Scott can hardly complain if this is being blown out of proportion (if indeed it is) with such a ridiculous response. &quot;hahahaha no&quot; is hardly satisfactory when considering as serious an issue as this. Whatever the relations between YUSU and <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>, students deserve a far more detailed response from &#039;our president&#039; when such matters are being banded about by a university news-outlet. If he doesn&#039;t comment on <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>, why not issue a statement to Nouse of Vision clarifying his position in the wake of such accusations?</p>
<p>#13, I accept you would like references for my quotes, but I am afraid that in many cases, people tell people things in confidence. You may choose whether or not to believe such claims, but I can assure you, there are many colleagues who are not 100% happy with the work our Cap&#039;n is doing. What they choose to do is down to them.</p>

<p>&quot;Why would he quit? By all accounts from those in the know he does precious little work, and picks up a reasonable salary for sitting around and occassionally dressing up as a pirate...&quot;</p>
<p>Erm... what?</p>
<p>Tom has been working his ass off like the rest of the officers. I&#039;ve heard no complaints from anyone on the YUSU Council and unlike you I --AM-- involved on a daily basis.</p>
<p>He probably doesn&#039;t get involved in Exec meetings too much.. he&#039;s still skeptical about university politics, I suspect, and there&#039;s no reason for him to get involved anyway! He attends the meetings, listens and learns, and makes informed policy decisions. What he&#039;s done this term is as much as what AMC did last year in the same time and as much as Croker before that.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don&#039;t recall seeing AMC Chair the executive meetings... are the Presidents supposed to? Not only that but MJB was here LAST year, so of course he&#039;ll end up leading a lot of discussions.</p>
<p>Another thing: nobody with a brain would ever tell you anything in confidence. FACT.</p>
<p>If you find me two YUSU Sabbs who say that they want him gone, I will propose the UGM myself. But you won&#039;t because there AREN&#039;T two YUSU Sabbs who want to get rid of him. I&#039;m certain that there are things about him that annoy some of the officers and I&#039;m certain that the same is true of Charlie, Jamie etc. They spend 10 hours a day together so they are likely to get on each others&#039; nerves... but I don&#039;t think anyone in the YUSU sabbatical team want him gone!</p>
<p>His quote of &quot;hahahahaha no&quot; was laughing off the suggestion as being a pathetic rumour that had no substantiation. It wasn&#039;t that he wasn&#039;t taking his job seriously and I don&#039;t know how you could even think of that. Maybe if someone has said &quot;do you care about the recent assaults?&quot; and he had answered with that then there would be questions asked but there is no need for them there.</p>
<p>I find it highly amusing that you even think that you talk to Sabbs about Tom Scott and that they talk back honestly. lol.</p>
