				Muhammad Ibn Adam Al-Kawthari (Second from right)			</div>
				<div class="Date">Sunday, 13th February 2011</div>
		<div class="Author">
			<a href="../../archive/reporter/526/index.html">Chiifen Hiu</a><br />
		</div>
		<div class="SubText">Several societies have formally spoken out against Mufti Muhammad ibn Adam al-Kawthari appearing as a guest speaker at York for Islam Week due to his policies on sexuality and women&rsquo;s rights. </div>

        <p>Mufti Muhammad ibn Adam, scheduled to speak at the University on Wednesday February 16th, is an Islamic scholar and a teacher who offers Islamic guidance on his online Sharia clinic <a href="http://www.daruliftaa.com/questions.asp?txt_CategoryID=CAT0000007&amp;intPage=2">Darul Iftaa.</a> His website made the news in July 2009, when the Sunday Mercury reported Darul Iftaa as one of the Sharia courts across the country to offer &ldquo;illegal fatwas&rdquo; that &ldquo;transgress human rights standards as applied by British courts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These include rulings on the website that state, &ldquo;When a man calls his wife for sexual intimacy, she should come, even if she is busy in the cooking area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another ruling states, &ldquo;As for the wife it is not permissible for her to leave her husband&rsquo;s house without his consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The article on the Sunday Mercury entitled &ldquo;Islamic Sharia Law courts operating in West Midlands&rdquo; can be accessed <a href="http://www.sundaymercury.net/news/midlands-news/2009/07/05/islamic-sharia-law-courts-operating-in-west-midlands-66331-24075255/2/">here</a>.</p>
<p>A report compiled by Denis MacEoin of the Institute for the Study of Civil Society London  (CIVITAS) entitled <a href="http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/MusicChessAndOtherSins.pdf">Music, Chess and other Sins</a> further noted, &ldquo;He rules that women may not swim (even for medical reasons) where a male lifeguard is present&rdquo; and &ldquo;the legal punishment for adultery is stoning&rdquo; amongst others.</p>
<p>In light of this, Mariel Stringer-Fehlow, Chairman of Amnesty International Society, Qaisar Siddiqui of StandforPeace, Felix Bungay of the Freedom Society, Peter Bartley of the Jewish Society, Jon Ward of the Conservatives Society and Zoe Lederman of the International Development Society have lodged an official complaint to YUSU about this matter, spearheaded by third-year undergraduate Sam Westrop.</p>
<p>Westrop, part of StandforPeace said, &ldquo;On behalf of a number of societies, we would like to stress that this is not a Freedom of Speech issue. It is however, a &ldquo;decency&rdquo; issue. We call upon the Student Unions and University authorities to condemn the speaker and his views, and to publicly urge the society hosting the event to either cancel or change the speaker.&quot;</p>
<p>Stringer-Fehlow further elaborated, &ldquo;If we campaign against homophobia and hate speech in other countries, how can we encourage it on our campus?&quot;</p>
<p>Receiving no response from YUSU on this matter, the coalition of students and societies have sent a letter to Vice Chancellor Brian Cantor on this issue. They have gathered support from numerous parties, including York Outer MP Julian Sturdy and left-wing journalist Nick Cohen.</p>
<p>Sturdy commented, &ldquo;I believe in the absolute importance of freedom of speech, but I am not happy that this vile speaker is using the university as a platform to produce tension in the community.&quot;</p>
<p>Furthermore, Cohen, Observer columnist and author of &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Left?&rdquo; provided his views on this matter, &ldquo;Freedom of speech includes the freedom of vile men to propagate foul views, but it does not exempt them from criticism. It is essential that students act as free men and women and correct, mock and refute reactionaries who stray on to their campuses. They should on no account allow enfeebling notions of political correctness to hold them back.&quot;</p>
<p>Several others have also lent their support to this matter, including Hasan Afzal, who is a Muslim anti-extremist activist.</p>
<p>According to the Communications Officer for the Institute for Middle Eastern Democracy, &ldquo;With less than a week since the Prime Minister made his speech in Munich condemning violent and non-violent preachers, it&#039;s to the lasting shame of York ISOC if they welcome this preacher of hate.&quot;</p>
<p>Westrop concluded, &ldquo;We, a coalition of Muslim, Jewish and other students of varying political and religious persuasions urge the Islamic Society to replace the speaker for this event with someone far less disgusting.&quot;</p>
<p>To this, York ISOC has released a statement refuting the claims against Mufti Muhammad ibn Adam.</p>
<p>Dina Salah, President of York ISOC stated, &ldquo;The complaints have been fuelled by a single press release by rightwing think-tank CIVITAS, which fails to reference the original source of the claims, instead recklessly sensationalising and listing views which have been taken completely out of context.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning a statement on Darul Iftaa that says, &ldquo;It is a grave sin for a woman to refuse sex to her husband&rdquo;, Salah refuted claims by the coalition of societies that Mufti Muhammad ibn Adam &ldquo;legitimises rape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Salah, &ldquo;The above extract omits a later extract that he notes in the same article, which directly delegitimizes rape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He adds that it does not in any way mean that the husband may force himself over her for sexual gratification &hellip; if the wife is not in a state to engage in sexual activities and has a genuine and valid reason, and the husband forces her, then he will be sinful,&rdquo; quoted Salah from the article, which can be found <a href="http://www.daruliftaa.com/question.asp?txt_QuestionID=q-07335282">here</a>.</p>
<p>Salah emphasised, &ldquo;It is important to note that socially conservative views should not be confused with violent extreme views &ndash; whilst one is completely abhorrent the other should be confronted and discussed openly through rational debate&hellip; How can there be meaningful progression in our society, when individuals seek to restrict opinions and prevent constructive challenges of diverse views?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ironically, the talk scheduled to be delivered by Muhammad Ibn Adam Al Kawthari is actually Misconceptions About Islam, aimed to clarify common misconceptions related to the very issues such as women&rsquo;s rights and Shariah law, which the societies have brought attention to,&rdquo; Salah continued.</p>
<p>Salah went on to say, &ldquo;Regarding the rest of the accusations, we invite all societies to come along to the talk on the 16th of February from 6:30 till 8:30 at PX / 001 and raise these issues in an open and friendly debate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Is there a special academy where homophobes, misogynists and racists learn these unconvincing excuses to justify their bigotry?!</p>
<p>The reason I ask is because every time they are confronted and asked to explain why they propagate such hateful and divisive views they say &ldquo;its taken out of context&rdquo;. Sorry&hellip; In what context are homophobia or misogyny ok?!! What&rsquo;s worse than the frequency these ridiculous excuses are used, is the way they always manage to deflect criticism and hoodwink everyone!</p>
<p>I noticed how Dinah Salah, did not deny Al-Kawthari had said these vile things, she just tried to explain them away by saying that his views were merely conservative views, as though this explains it!</p>
<p>She said:<br />
&ldquo;It is important to note that socially conservative views should not be confused with violent extreme views.&rdquo; I think it is Miss Salah who is confused, so I will clarify- Justifying rape and fomenting hate against homosexuals is not a conservative view- it is an incitement to hatred and violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;the whole aim of our Islam Awareness Week is to create dialogue and understanding with all students in University&rdquo;- yep ALL STUDENTS unless you are gay, female or anyone else who Al Kawthari thinks should be lashed for who they are.</p>
<p>Disgusting.</p>

<p>Let&#039;s get one thing clear; homophobia is not the belief that homosexuality is a sin, it the contempt and intolerance of such a lifestyle and actions based on that contempt. Islam is a religion of mercy and the best people are those who prefer for others what they love for themselves. Isn&#039;t that pretty now?<br />
All the stonings, choppings, beheadings, raping, lootings and pillaging that we muslims do every weekend, (oh let&#039;s not forget bombings), and get everyone so worked up...erm, don&#039;t really happen. Hate to break it ya guys. We tend to cook biryani and watch football.<br />
I am curious to understand what Sam Westrop, (along with the obligatory &#039;muslim mates&#039; who add kudos to his views, they&#039;re on his side init) in his crusade against all things muslimic, fears from this speaker. Does he imagine that the audience will spontaneously be inspired to start committing hate crimes around campus? No? Then why not let the speaker have his say...I&#039;m sure if he&#039;s a misogynistic homophobe, he&#039;ll end up exposing himself dreadfully and then <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span> can write an even MORE gleeful article on the topic. Yay! Islamophobia sells don&#039;t ya know. (along with sex, but that&#039;s not misogynistic in the slightest, no sireee, we call that liberation, yee haa)<br />
For people trying to understand Islam, its important not to approach it from an Orientalist perspective, this will inevitably be a big fat obstruction to your understanding anything. Ask yourself why Islam is constantly the victim of the propaganda machine, maybe someone out there doesn&#039;t want you to know something that might free you from the shackles of a soulless capitalist producer-consumer society. Great fun to be had if you&#039;re a conspiracy theorist too.<br />
Islam changed the face of this Earth forever. It elevated a bunch of ignorant Arabs to become the rulers of the world (that&#039;s a historical fact ya know). Millions of people drop to their knees simultaneously in prayer before a Lord who spoke to all humanity and invited us to a way that is truthful. Can they all be absolutely barmy?<br />
Peace out.</p>

<p>23: get over yourself. Islam is a victim of the &#039;propaganda machine&#039;? I&#039;ll admit some of the redtop press are quick to smear Islam as the perpetrator of anything but when 4 young men from Dewsbury kill over 50 people and invoke Islamic beliefs for the reason of doing so, and people march in protest of people drawing cartoons, replete with banners saying &quot;Behead those who insult Islam&quot; you&#039;ll understand my scepticism.</p>
<p>Also i don&#039;t believe this article is gleeful as you so put it; it&#039;s merely reporting the facts on either side; it&#039;s not a comment piece. The fact that you jump to &#039;islamophobia&#039; when people are merely horrified that a person who professes such archaic views is not only not shouted down but venerated, says more about your blindness than it does about anyone else</p>

<p>...didn&#039;t millions of Greeks and Romans do the same thing? Not to mention billions worship Christ, almost a billion Hindus worship their gods...what exactly is your point here? Just because x number of people do something, doesn&#039;t make it better or right.</p>
<p>That&#039;s just one fault of many in your argument. Understand that I respect Islam like all religions, but your rant is full of self-righteousness and intolerance for anything that&#039;s different to you.</p>

<p>Sam needs to end his blind and baseless campaign against the ISOC; it is a student society which have organised a week to promote the religion they believe in and eradicate misconceptions.  Some of the hateful statements commentators have made in this page have sickened me and made me ashamed of my fellow Brits.  Such hypocrisy shown by Sam on the radio bbc york; he wants the speaker to be banned from coming and yet believes in freedom of speech; wants him to be banned from coming yet wants him to come so that he can be ridiculed?? Seems a bit confusing to me.</p>
<p>If you really believe he is a homophobic, mysogonist speaker let him speak so that his chasracter can be exposed the same way your intolerance of Islam has been exposed.</p>
<p>I hate to break it to people but the average joe in the pub on an evening disagres with homosexuality, so does Christiannity and so does Judaism so why the hate? He is merely trying to make a point that in an Islamic state fornoication would not be allowed and would be punished accordingly; he is not saying that fornaication in this country should be punished because this country is NOT an Islamic state! however many ignorantly and some intentionally are taking things out of context</p>

<ul id="CommentItem10656History" class="comment_edit"><li>Fri, 18th Feb 2011 12:51am - Edited by the author</li></ul><p>As for adulterers and homosexuals, do you want me to show you the beliefs in the BIBLE and in the TORAH about the punishments for similar? Shall I show you about the verses about even babies being killed?<br />
Now where are the people with hypocritical and one-sided thinking? Are they now going to condemn the Bible and the Torah?<br />
Now the real question is not the laws and rules of Islam, but rather the proofs of Islam since if it can be proven that the Qur&#039;an is the Word of God, that it is a supernatural revelation, then no amount of moral relativism or liberalism can say the Islam is wrong.<br />
As for sickening concepts, the only ones who would find them sickening are those who failed to understand the context, paradigms, and fail to open their eyes to other views and evidences.<br />
Such rules would only be barabaric according to some people, not all people, according to some views, not all views, according to some worldviews, not all worldviews. If one adopts relativism, specifically moral relativism, then one can&#039;t condemn other cultures. And this by anthropologists is mentioned because everyone is influenced by their own cultural factors and environment and can&#039;t fully understand others.<br />
Now what we need to do is consider the whole picture. Whatever is from God cannot be classified as barbaric at all, since it is He Who owns all and sustains all and has rights over creation. The creation (neither me nor you or anyone else) have rights over Allah/God. Thus whatever He does is not a violation of any right, thus not unjust. He can do whatever.<br />
Furthermore since He is our Creater, knowing the intricacies if human nature, full knowledge of everything, something psychology nor any science or materialistic philosophy can achieve, He is best suited to establish our laws and know what is best for us.<br />
One only needs to look at the amount of crime in the USA in terms of murders and compare it to the murder rate in Saudi Arabia, or the rate of theft.<br />
Also just look at the Prophetic example of where he forgave the one who killed his own child. He forgave many who tried to kill him. How many people can actually do that? What Prophet Muhammed (Sallalahu alaihi wa sallam) then bloodthirsty as some bigots say he is? Clearly no!<br />
It is clear that those who campaigned against the ISOC of York and the speaker are on an agenda of hatred, bigotry and intolerance, and this is shown by the earlier calls to ban the speaker and to mock him, instead of dealing with his arguments. It is the peak of intolerance to accuse other people of intolerance or to ban them just because you do not agree with him.<br />
I think people should go learn some basic logic and stop using emotional arguments.</p>

<p>Well the Torah and the Bible do have an anti-homosexual passage. But I don&#039;t see Christian and Jewish nations hanging people because of their sexuality. I think Israel even had a gay pride march.<br />
Maybe the theft rate in Saudi Arabia is lower. But is it a better society? You&#039;re saying the means justifies the end, like all totalitarians do.<br />
People are not campaigning on the basis of bigotry and intolerance. A lot of us are just simply pointing out the person&#039;s views are archaic and hardly someone that should be idolised. And immediately after pointing this out we are accused of Islamophobia etc. It&#039;s rather irritating<br />
As for your views on God, I&#039;m not getting involved in this. And to 30 the average person on the street does not disagree with homosexuality as any opinion poll of the last 10 years will show you. Maybe you need to hang out wiht different people</p>
