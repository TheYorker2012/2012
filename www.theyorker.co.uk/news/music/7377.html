        <p><strong>23:52</strong> As The Struts play out the main stage to an enthusiastic crowd, <em><span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span></em> calls it a night.  I&#039;m going to go and see if they&#039;ll let me play with those fiery things and celebrate my decisive win in Spot the BNOC.  Night all!
<a href="../../photos/full/7916.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/7916.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="The Struts" alt="The Struts"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>23:48</strong> From the dress sense and haircut of the lead, I&#039;d add Aerosmith as one of those influences...</p>
<p><strong>23:43</strong> A song dedicated to Mini owners.  Obviously.</p>
<p><strong>23:41</strong> They&#039;ve finished a song and everyone&#039;s happy.  That&#039;s nice.  Bit of audience participation going on now.</p>
<p><strong>23:33</strong> Lots of clapping and some band profiling. Get on with it!</p>
<p><strong>23:31</strong> Note: Final act are on time to the stage... how very strange...</p>
<p><strong>23:30</strong> The Struts on stage now to cheers and whoops.</p>
<p><strong>23:28</strong> Vanbrugh Paradise swells expectantly.  Or perhaps not.</p>
<p><strong>23:25</strong> Final shot from Central Hall:
<a href="../../photos/full/7915.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/7915.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Central Hall, end of the day" alt="Central Hall, end of the day"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>23:24</strong> Their facebook page lists their influences as Beatles, Stones, Oasis, Queen, Hendrix, Led Zep, and AC/DC.  This clarifies things.</p>
<p><strong>23:22</strong> Samba keeping the crowd entertained as headline act The Struts set up.  Google tells me they&#039;re a four-piece from Derby.  Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>23:18</strong> Repeated shouts of &quot;We want more&quot; don&#039;t get the crowd anywhere. Bit of a bum note for the band there.</p>
<p><strong>23:16</strong> The Hung, Outdoor Stage:
<a href="../../photos/full/7914.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/7914.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="The Hung" alt="The Hung"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>23:11</strong> The Hung are finishing their set with a Cher cover.  Alex has returned, and so have the fiery things! Yay!</p>
<p><strong>23:10</strong> True mindset of a rockstar, &quot;I have no idea what&#039;s going on!?&quot; yells out a band member before &#039;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&#039; causes the crowd to go all out dance crazy.</p>
<p><strong>23:09</strong> Where did the fiery things go? I was distracted by &#039;Are you gonna be my girl?&#039;.</p>
<p><strong>23:03</strong> Students join in on stage as &#039;Killing in the Name&#039; starts.</p>
<p><strong>23:02</strong> Obligatory Rage Against the Machine cover. Didn&#039;t they do this last year?</p>
<p><strong>23:00</strong> This is decidedly better than the current headliners on the Pyramid Stage.</p>
<p><strong>22:55</strong> Up and dancing to a cover of The Who&#039;s &#039;Pinball Wizard&#039;.</p>
<p><strong>22:52</strong> Cover of &#039;Boys are back in Town&#039; rocking out the main stage. The sing-alongs are back.</p>
<p><strong>22:50</strong> <em><span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span></em> has relocated to Vanbrugh Paradise where there are lots of people and it&#039;s a bit dark.</p>
<p><strong>22:49</strong> Penultimate main stage act of the night underway. The Hung play to a crowd just as strong as the daytime set listers.</p>
<p><strong>22:44</strong> What with him and Fusion Extraodinaire Fiona Lavelle hanging around, I&#039;ve got this in the bag.</p>
<p><strong>22:42</strong> URY&#039;s Joe Hook has arrived, putting me back in the lead for Spot the BNOC.</p>
<p><strong>22:40</strong> Tom &#039;The Gregornator&#039; Gregory: &quot;It&#039;s the best event of the year!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>22:38</strong> Chuck Jager on the main stage a short time ago
<a href="../../photos/full/7913.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/7913.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>22:32</strong> Chuck Jager also plugging their CD.  Their one is free, apparently.</p>
<p><strong>22:31</strong> Oooh, Alex has spotted people with a Sky News camera - could York (and Chuck Jager) be getting a little fifteen minutes of fame?</p>
<p><strong>22:29</strong> NOOO!! They&#039;ve shut the food stalls! What are we bloggers to do? Perhaps an Efes <em>is</em> in order.  In the meantime, more Chuck Jager and more crazy moshing.</p>
<p><strong>22:25</strong> Blake Funk Big Band appears to feature ukeleles and cellos.  Ooooh. We&#039;ve just heard someone comparing the fine York culinary establishments of Efes and Okis.  Anyone drunk enough for that yet?</p>
<p><strong>22:22</strong> </p>

<p><strong>22:15</strong> Blake Funk Big Band are preparing to go on at the indoor stage.  Outside, Chuck Jager&#039;s Mystery Jets cover going down a storm.</p>
<p><strong>22:12</strong> Video on its way of Juggle Soc and their Fiery Things.</p>
<p><strong>22:06</strong> With a flurry of electric guitar riffs, they&#039;re off and there is some rather hilarious dancing down the front...</p>
<p><strong>22:05</strong> Chuck Jager are shouting things on the main stage but haven&#039;t started playing yet.</p>
<p><strong>22:03</strong> Dusk settles as we admire the view from Central Hall

<p><strong>21:47</strong> Massive applause as TMC close with shouts for more.  In other news, Juggle Soc have set things on FIRE!</p>
<p><strong>21:43</strong> Bit of sales promo from The Mountaineering Club there. New EP indeed. Last song of the set starting outside, meanwhile The Poubelle Booms finish their set with a lively cover of Cee Lo Green&#039;s &#039;F*ck You&#039;.  Crowd ruddy loving it.</p>
<p><strong>21:41</strong> Mountaineering club slowing the synth rock for a moment just as the sun starts to set and the flaming baton twirling starts.</p>
<p><strong>21:36</strong> He did it! Wahey, well done Tim

<p><strong>21:31</strong> Poubelle Booms are slowing the pace indoors, with a cover of Daniel Merriweather&#039;s &#039;Red&#039;.</p>
<p><strong>21:26</strong> Right. Video&#039;s on it&#039;s way, in the meantime why not enjoy the ambient post-rock of The Mountaineering Club on the outdoor stage? Cinematic soundscapes that combine classical and jazz sounds with electro influences, yum.</p>
<p><strong>21:18</strong> I hate technology.</p>
<p><strong>21:18</strong> OK, let&#039;s try this again. Here&#039;s YUSU President Tim Ngwena on his final stretch of marathon</p>
<p><strong>21:17</strong> Oh blast.</p>
<p><strong>21:02</strong> Video interview with the BNOC that is Tim Ngwena coming soon...</p>
<p><strong>21:00</strong> Crowd demanding &#039;One more song!&#039; Taming the Savage oblige with a cover of U2&#039;s &#039;With Or Without You&#039;</p>
<p><strong>20:56</strong> Taming the Savage have got the crowd dancing on Vanbrugh Paradise with &#039;One Thing&#039;</p>
<p><strong>20:42</strong> Taming the Savage out on the main stage.  I wonder if they&#039;ll play that song about an alarm clock that they do. Simon&#039;s gone to investigate.</p>
<p><strong>20:36</strong> Issy Hall has bought me a coffee because she&#039;s lovely and amazing. Shout out as promised. Thanks Issy!</p>
<p><strong>20:33</strong> TIM IN VANBRUGH PORTERS!</p>
<p><strong>20:33</strong> Taming the Savage on stage shortly out on Vanbrugh Paradise, whilst Deaf Jam are about to liven things up in the dining hall.</p>
<p><strong>20:31</strong> Tim on campus... GO NGWENA!</p>
<p><strong>20:29</strong> Tim Ngwena on the last hill back to campus. Get ready guys! (I WILL spot him first, thus convincingly winning Spot the BNOC).</p>
<p><strong>20:28</strong> Cheesy Pop Soc had everyone doing the Macarena, we&#039;re told.</p>
<p><strong>20:26</strong> Simon&#039;s here! With a working camera whoopee!</p>
<p><strong>20:18</strong> Alex is waiting for Tim just off campus and hoping he&#039;s actually stood on part of the route.</p>
<p><strong>20:12</strong> <a href="../../photos/full/7906.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/7906.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>20:03</strong> Tim Ngwena spotted running past the sports centre, about three miles left of his marathon journey.</p>
<p><strong>20:02</strong> MAJOR ISSUES WITH VANBRUGH LADIES LOOS.  Apparently only the toilets in C-Block and the disabled ones are available.  Disastrous, there&#039;s always a queue.</p>
<p><strong>19:58</strong> The board tells us Tim is now listening to Britney Spears. You know who else likes Britney? <em><span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span></em>&rsquo;s very own Michael Tansini.</p>
<p><strong>19:57</strong> Rebecca Irwin&#039;s back.  She likes our videos.  This makes us happy.</p>
<p><strong>19:48</strong> The laid back sounds currently brought to the indoor stage by Imogen Dow are gradually drawing quite a crowd.</p>
<p><strong>19:47</strong> Four miles left for Tim Ngwena as he runs along to the sounds of &#039;Smooth Criminal&#039;.  Meanwhile, Ambulance have everyone foot-tapping outside with their crazy-over-dramatic-but-in-a-sweet-way front man.</p>
<p><strong>19:42</strong> Imogen Dow opening with a little number called &#039;The Breakfast Song&#039;.  &#039;It&#039;s about eating breakfast,&#039; she explains.  Now that&#039;s clear, mouthwatering music is underway inside, featuring the first violin Alex has spotted all day.</p>
<p><strong>19:35</strong> Ambulance are now on the main stage and Jane&#039;s very excited.</p>
<p><strong>19:32</strong> YUSU President Tim Ngwena&#039;s marathon is being blogged at Vanbrugh Stalls.  Not far to go now, Tim!</p>
<p><strong>19:26</strong> Indoor and outdoor stages winding down for a changeover.  If I didn&#039;t know any better, I&#039;d say RAG was conspiring against us so we&#039;ll go and spend more cash as a distraction.  Imogen Dow up next inside, whilst Ambulance take to the main stage outdoors.</p>
<p><strong>19:19</strong> Star Shaped City close their set with &#039;Is it too late?&#039; on the outdoor stage.</p>
<p><strong>19:14</strong> As promised earlier, here&#039;s Dance Soc pulling off some impressive routines in the hall this afternoon

<p><strong>19:12</strong> Alex reports that the earlier lack of buns issue at the outside grill has now been resolved and he would like someone to buy him a burger. Jeez, we&#039;re a needy lot, aren&#039;t we?</p>
<p><strong>19:12</strong> Meanwhile, proper little jazz jam going on in the JCR.</p>
<p><strong>19:11</strong> Star Shaped City rocking out to quite a mellow audience.  What happened to the sing-along? I want &#039;Hey Jude&#039;.</p>
<p><strong>19:09</strong> Alex hears music coming from the main stage and likes it. Jane doesn&#039;t.</p>
<p><strong>19:08</strong> The YUSU Women&#039;s Committee are winding down after a day of sessions including art workshops body hair and vajazzling. Facepainters are still out in force.  I want to be a Thundercat!</p>
<p><strong>19:01</strong> Interesting things have been happening around Vanbrugh Paradise all day.  Alex has gone to investigate. I hope he brings back coffee.  And an ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>18:57</strong> Indoor and outdoor stages in change-over mode, and the JCR&#039;s full.  I&#039;m going to resume my game of Spot the BNOC.</p>
<p><strong>18:55</strong> I&#039;m still waiting on that coffee, by the way.  Although I will give a special mention to the nice man that just came and complimented us on the liveblog.  Thank you, nice man!</p>
<p><strong>18:53</strong> A video of Dance Soc is somewhere in the ether... shall appear shortly.  After it&#039;s finished &#039;rendering&#039;, whatever that means.</p>
<p><strong>18:46</strong> And an ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>18:46</strong> Sleeeeepy.  I have a special mention available for whoever&#039;s good enough to bring me a coffee.</p>
<p><strong>18:41</strong> Acoustic sets in the JCR much more chilled than elsewhere and drawing in the crowds.</p>
<p><strong>18:40</strong> A sadly empty hall for Turning Down Skye, seems everyone&#039;s lapping up the sing-along outside.  Alex suggests getting indoors for a more personal gig.</p>
<p><strong>18:38</strong> Bits and pieces from the main stage a short while ago

<p><strong>18:33</strong> Vanbrugh Paradise jam packed as the sing-a-longs begin.</p>
<p><strong>18:27</strong> Dance Soc
<a href="../../photos/full/7904.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/7904.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>18:19</strong> More burgers. Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>18:13</strong> There is a fellow in the JCR singing &#039;Get Low&#039; in a beautiful acoustic style. Jane greatly approves.</p>
<p><strong>18:12</strong> Alex: &quot;Maybe I spoke too soon, perhaps this is West End material! Shouts for encore, dancers all over the stage.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>18:11</strong> Lots of intense stares, hair flying, big smiles,oh and good dancing too from Dance Soc but watching it is like being on a packed underground train! Seems Vanbrugh hall&#039;s packed out.</p>
<p><strong>18:08</strong> Finger-clicking stuff, this dancing.  No really, it&#039;s a major part of the routine.</p>
<p><strong>17:59</strong> Ah, many people are out in their Sunday Vests, welcome to the gun show!</p>
<p><strong>17:57</strong> Somebody is currently murdering Robbie William&#039;s Angels on the mainstage, it appears to be karaoke hour??</p>
<p><strong>17:56</strong> Glastonbury fashion is alive and well at Woodstock I&#039;m happy to report, though the combination of wellies and pyjama shorts is perhaps a little too far...</p>
<p><strong>17:53</strong> Alex is still watching the dancing in the dining hall.  He reports of another dress change before some energetic street dancing starts.</p>
<p><strong>17:50</strong> Ben White and Luke Heron have started their set in the JCR with an acoustic cover of Wheatus&#039; &#039;Teenage Dirtbag&#039;.  Memories of being a twelve year-old abound.</p>
<p><strong>17:47</strong> Rich has left, but sends this last message: &quot;The security men&#039;s rough tough image is being ruined by the fact that they are all now sucking lollipops.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>17:45</strong> &quot;Calm down Dance Soc... A costume change? It&#039;s not the West End.&quot; - Alex</p>
<p><strong>17:44</strong> Dance Soc introducing on the indoor stage right now, Alex reports the tap dancers are rocking out to &#039;London Calling&#039;.</p>
<p><strong>17:40</strong> Ah Good the Sea on Woodstock&#039;s main stage
<a href="../../photos/full/7903.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/7903.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>17:37</strong> Rich has to leave shortly unfortunately. He&#039;s very sorry about this, especially as he only got to see Rich Blake in one of his three appearances. And as he&#039;s just seen a huge trolley of Strongbow wheeled past.</p>
<p><strong>17:35</strong> A bit of what&#039;s going on in Vanbrugh JCR
<a href="../../photos/full/7902.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/7902.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>17:29</strong> Wow, Alex wangled his way onto the YSTV balcony to sample some of Ah Good The Sea&#039;s set. Smooth.</p>
<p><strong>17:27</strong> Legally of course.</p>
<p><strong>17:27</strong> Just a side-note, today&#039;s videos are being uploaded on Sony Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 10.0 Super Duper Double Plus X Good Fantastic. Lucie sure knows where to find the best software...</p>
<p><strong>17:24</strong> &#039;It&#039; being entirely subjective...</p>
<p><strong>17:22</strong> Rich has just returned from Ah Good The Sea on the outside stage. They&#039;ve pulled in a great crowd and are wowing with their funky sounds. Tom Adams is hollering passionately while Rich Blake is to be found in particularly bouncy mood. Cheesy guitar maneuvers are what its all about.</p>
<p><strong>17:17</strong> I WIN THE BNOC GAME! Tom &#039;The Gregornator&#039; Gregory has just arrived, that&#039;s fifty points.</p>
<p><strong>17:15</strong> Ah Good The Sea take to the stage as crowds swell outside.</p>
<p><strong>17:14</strong> I myself sampled a burger earlier. Good stuff.</p>
<p><strong>17:13</strong> John is eating his sandwich but is slightly regretful that he was not aware of the burgers being sold just a few feet away. &#039;Buyer&#039;s regret&#039; as he himself puts it.</p>
<p><strong>17:11</strong> Jane reports there is a man dressed as Pikachu, and she chooses him.</p>
<p><strong>17:11</strong> Lucie has returned from Lewis Haines&#039; set in the JCR. We&#039;re told that he is issuing nice acoustic-y guitar sounds and that he just ended a song with some fancy harmonics. Lucie&#039;s final verdict is that he should ditch the vocals and stick with the guitar.</p>
<p><strong>17:09</strong> Called Pinkstar Destiny. No comment.</p>
<p><strong>17:08</strong> Inspired by the Hornets, Florence and John are thinking of forming their own dance troupe.</p>
<p><strong>17:08</strong> We would also like to take this opportunity to confirm that Ah good the sea are named AFTER the graffiti on Retreat Lane, and they are not, in fact, the vandals responsible for it. Apparently.</p>
<p><strong>17:05</strong> Capoeira. How do you pronounce that?</p>
<p><strong>17:04</strong> Jugglers are relaxing by the lake. Everyday I&#039;m juggling...</p>
<p><strong>17:03</strong> John is in fact now convinced that most people here are doppelgangers and have been shipped in from another University.</p>
<p><strong>17:00</strong> John Cummins is here. He&#039;s shocked by how many people are here that he has never seen at the uni before...</p>
<p><strong>16:59</strong> York Hornets are passing us now, returning from their set in the Dining Hall. I&#039;m told they got a huge crowd in, yet they still carry their own mats and equipment away once they&#039;re done. That&#039;s true professionalism for you.</p>
<p><strong>16:54</strong> Rich Blake is ACTUALLY running Woodstock. He&#039;s set to appear with three bands tonight: Ah good the sea, The Mountaineering Club and Blake Funk Big Band. No prizes for guessing which one is the vanity project.</p>
<p><strong>16:53</strong> Alex: &quot;The outside stage has a nice Mumford and Sons cover going.  We like Mumford and their English Lit references.&quot; Rich would like to make it clear that this is not the opinion of the entire Yorker Arts team.</p>
<p><strong>16:51</strong> Alex gets off the mark re: BNOC game, with a spotting of Vanbrugh Chair Kallum Taylor.  Well done Alex, five points.</p>
<p><strong>16:49</strong> A bit of ACS. Gotta love that motown...

<p><strong>16:46</strong> After last night&#039;s surprise Radiohead set on the Park Stage at Glasto, they&#039;ve announced that Pulp will be pulling a similar stunt at 7:45pm tonight. I&#039;d make my way over for it but that would mean missing Ambulance, Imogen Dow, The Mountaineering Club and other quality acts...</p>
<p><strong>16:41</strong> &#039;Go ahead, Lucie. Nap! That won&#039;t happen again...&#039;</p>
<p><strong>16:40</strong> Lucie feels in need of a nap but is wary of a repeat of last year when she took forty winks only to wake up and find that Pete had captured the moment on film and had broadcast it to the world.</p>
<p><strong>16:37</strong> More dancing frivolity indoors, as Dancesport take over Vanbrugh Dining Hall.</p>
<p><strong>16:36</strong> Rich is back from his exploration of the sounds coming from the JCR. They turned out to be the dulcet tones of Tom Lovatt. Very nice but my assessment is that he needs a good old fashioned cheering up. Maybe we should take him to the Sambuca stall and then invite him for a dance?</p>
<p><strong>16:31</strong> Alex: &#039;Everybody shout ghostbusters!&#039;</p>
<p><strong>16:30</strong> Alex reports that The Rammers are rocking the main stage.</p>
<p><strong>16:29</strong> Jane and Farah&#039;s lovely facepaint
<a href="../../photos/full/7900.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/7900.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>16:28</strong> Ooh hang on, there&#039;s singing coming from the JCR now, I&#039;m going to investigate...</p>
<p><strong>16:26</strong> Extensive guitar tuning going on in the JCR. Just how many strings does he have??</p>
<p><strong>16:23</strong> Trying to work out what constitutes as a BNOC; maybe if I could get enough &#039;one pointers&#039;...?</p>
<p><strong>16:22</strong> However, we&#039;re taking some pictures of some more successful face-painting right now. Expect the results on screen shortly!</p>
<p><strong>16:21</strong> If it doesn&#039;t look like a tiger, I&#039;d like to know what it looks like...</p>
<p><strong>16:21</strong> Gillian reports that someone&#039;s just asked for their money back because their facepaint doesn&#039;t look like a tiger. We think they&#039;re serious...</p>
<p><strong>16:16</strong> We&#039;re just taking a look at the Glastonbury webcam. It&#039;s good to know that other people in other places are having fun too, even if it isn&#039;t anywhere near as much fun as Woodstock.</p>
<p><strong>16:14</strong> Lucie is trying to explain the technicalities of posting the videos to Rich. Frankly it&#039;s all to much for his small head to take.</p>
<p><strong>16:13</strong> Rich is sat admiring our videos.  And rightly so.</p>
<p><strong>16:11</strong> Lots of girls in pretty dresses have just walked past. They look nice.</p>
<p><strong>16:10</strong> Rich returns from rehearsal to find Lucie has continued the game of BNOC and now possesses an unassailable lead. Damn.</p>
<p><strong>16:09</strong> ACS are getting everyone in the hall to stand up and dance about. Sitting banned, hip-shaking win.</p>
<p><strong>16:07</strong> Rich is back! LOOK RICH I&#039;M A TECHNICAL GENIUS WE HAVE VIDEOS LOOK AT ALL THE VIDEOS</p>
<p><strong>16:06</strong> Satire Editor Gillian Love&#039;s just popped round to tell everyone about the Women&#039;s Committee stall. Go and check it out!</p>
<p><strong>16:05</strong> ACS open with &#039;Superstitious&#039;: trumpet, sax, guitars, drums, the works.  Everyone surges forward at the indoor stage, hall packed and loving the motown.</p>
<p><strong>16:03</strong> Some clips of Step Up York:

<p><strong>15:58</strong> ACS are getting their motown groove on. Audience is loving it.</p>
<p><strong>15:55</strong> ACS on final soundcheck in the dining hall, everyone&#039;s taking positions.  Can you feel the excitement building? In other news, my webcam&#039;s just switched itself on and I don&#039;t know why. I&#039;m not live streaming this somewhere, am I?</p>
<p><strong>15:51</strong> Some clips of Step Up York will be ready in precisely nine minutes and forty two seconds.</p>
<p><strong>15:50</strong> Alcuin Chair Lizzie Bartholomew sighted, I&#039;ll take that five points.</p>
<p><strong>15:49</strong> A big brass band is currently playing on the main stage outside. I&#039;m going for a pint.</p>
<p><strong>15:46</strong> My laptop&#039;s going crazy.  Nicht gut.</p>
<p><strong>15:34</strong> Jane&#039;s returned.  A raft of now-slightly-irrelevant photos and videos is on its way.</p>
<p><strong>15:32</strong> Which acts are you most looking forward to? &quot;I was really looking forward to Step Up York, it was amazing! I also can&#039;t wait to see who the winner of York&#039;s Got Talent is, we had so many really good acts compete.  As for bands, I really want to see the Poubelle Booms and Taming the Savage - I love them!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>15:30</strong> &quot;It&#039;s all going really well, we&#039;re all really happy - we have way bigger attendance than the same time last year - it&#039;s great to see Vanbrugh so packed out!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>15:27</strong> RAG Chair Rebecca Irwin has come over for a chat! How are things, Rebecca?</p>
<p><strong>15:27</strong> President Elect Tim Ellis with a little tango number there.  Finally, an act with a handjive from the jazz.</p>
<p><strong>15:21</strong> Alex: Street Dancing has everyone entertained.  Kudos to Emily Saunders.</p>
<p><strong>15:20</strong> Jane and Alex have gone to watch the Latin dancing in the dining hall.  Alex reports it was a polished routine with some not so strong guys throwing some rather worried looking girls around the floor and into the air. Health and safety field day, what.  Jane says the new welfare rep Bob Hughes is &#039;sexy&#039;.</p>
<p><strong>15:18</strong> It works! Jamie is magic.</p>
<p><strong>15:17</strong> Here&#039;s that Samba video from earlier *crosses fingers*

<p><strong>15:14</strong> Ballet is providing some high culture in the dining hall.</p>
<p><strong>15:10</strong> Step Up York about to start! BNOCs EVERYWHERE.</p>
<p><strong>15:09</strong> Music Editor Alex Jackson has arrived and gone to investigate what sounds like an acoustic version of &#039;Use Somebody&#039; by Kings of Leon.</p>
<p><strong>15:04</strong> Lots of people in tutus.  If they&#039;re not involved with the ballet performance then that&#039;s just a bit weird.</p>
<p><strong>15:03</strong> Just seen a Vanbrugh porter looking mildly disgruntled.  Perhaps we should turn the music down?</p>
<p><strong>15:00</strong> Girl in purple wellies. <em>Now</em> it feels like a festival.</p>
<p><strong>14:57</strong> Pole Excercise are bending into all sorts of positions in Vanbrugh Dining Hall.  Jane&#039;s gone for photos.</p>
<p><strong>14:56</strong> Jamie (Captain Videocasts) has arrived! Issues will be resolved promptly.</p>
<p><strong>14:47</strong> There is a video of Samba Band somewhere in the depths of my laptop.  It shall hopefully appear soon. Then again, maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>14:42</strong> Another BNOC, this time it&#039;s Camilla Apcar, general campus celebrity.</p>
<p><strong>14:38</strong> I got Nick Scarlett earlier Jane, you should have been paying attention.  Samba band are livening things up out on Vanbrugh Paradise right now.</p>
<p><strong>14:37</strong> There is a lot of screaming - Halifax are bleeding people dry, but it&#039;s all in the name of charity! I&#039;ve just seen a man wrestled to the ground and &pound;20 physically wrenched from his hand.. ouch</p>
<p><strong>14:35</strong> mwahaha it&#039;s Jane here now, enjoying the view from V Bar... 10 points to me for Nick Scarlett.  Its a shoo in now!</p>
<p><strong>14:34</strong> I&#039;m leaving Jane alone with the laptop. Is this a good idea? I sense an error of judgement.</p>
<p><strong>14:32</strong> You can tell us by our lovely orange and grey...
<a href="../../photos/full/7899.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/7899.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="<span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> at Woodstock" alt="<span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> at Woodstock"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>14:30</strong> Jane&#039;s just claimed another 10 points for Dan Walker.  It&#039;s level pegging.  I need to up my game.</p>
<p><strong>14:29</strong> There seems to be a general lull.  In case anyone&#039;s wondering, we&#039;re based in V Bar.  Come and say hello! (Please don&#039;t leave me alone with Jane...)</p>
<p><strong>14:26</strong> Alcuinites out in force for Woodstock
<a href="../../photos/full/7898.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/7898.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>14:24</strong> Face painting on Vanbrugh Paradise
<a href="../../photos/full/7897.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/7897.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Woodstock face painting" alt="Woodstock face painting"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>14:20</strong> Current score tally - Lucie: 40, Jane: 30, Rich: 5.</p>
<p><strong>14:18</strong> Jane&#039;s joined in the BNOC game with York Clemo (25 points) and Stephen O&#039;Ryan (former YUSU Ents officer - five points).</p>
<p><strong>14:17</strong> Jane tells me there&#039;s a super depressing man currently weeping into a microphone on the main stage.  The audience is generally enjoying a beer or five.  Pic&#039;n&#039;mix now on sale! Give the singer some, it sounds like he could do with some cheering up.</p>
<p><strong>14:15</strong> Jane&#039;s taken the camera and wandered off in the direction of the main stage.  What wondrous wonders lie in wait I wonder?</p>
<p><strong>14:12</strong> Jane&#039;s come to join the liveblog fun! *CHEERS AND WHOOPS!*</p>
<p><strong>14:10</strong> York&#039;s Got Talent act on stage at the mo is two male singers plus a guitar.  I hear the sounds of &quot;Taaaake ooooon meeeeeeee...&quot;</p>
<p><strong>14:07</strong> YUSU PRESIDENT ELECT TIM ELLIS SPOTTED! I&#039;ll take 20 points for that one thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>14:03</strong> Pole Exercise up next in the dining hall.</p>
<p><strong>14:01</strong> Coming up later in the day are the BNOCs of campus bands: Ambulance, Taming the Savage,Chuck Jager, and The Mountaineering Club to name a few.  The Mountaineering Club made it onto the bill for End of the Road festival this year, well done them.</p>
<p><strong>13:56</strong> ... I think I broke it.</p>
<p><strong>13:55</strong> <a href="../../photos/full/7896.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/7896.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>13:50</strong> Band currently performing to be named York&#039;s Got Talent winners are doing a cover of &#039;Feeling Good&#039;.  I hear harmonies and approve greatly.</p>
<p><strong>13:45</strong> Chris Reardon spied, that&#039;s another five points.</p>
<p><strong>13:44</strong> V Bar now open! Is it Pimms o&#039;clock yet?</p>
<p><strong>13:40</strong> [<em>Rich exits stage left, to return later</em>].</p>
<p><strong>13:39</strong> Ah Bagpipe Man is now playing! And very bagpipey it is too.</p>
<p><strong>13:34</strong> Wow, a real singer, she&#039;s good!</p>
<p><strong>13:32</strong> Soulful tones emitting from dining room... going to investigate...</p>
<p><strong>13:31</strong> Aha, Rich is back in the game with the spot of Darren Webb, URY Station Manager!</p>
<p><strong>13:30</strong> Oh wait...</p>
<p><strong>13:30</strong> But he still thinks it&#039;s impressive that Lucie has just seen James Corden, even if he&#039;s not a big Gavin and Stacey fan.</p>
<p><strong>13:29</strong> Concert Band doing their thang.</p>
<p><strong>13:29</strong> <a href="../../photos/full/7894.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/7894.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>13:29</strong> Rich&#039;s BNOC game isn&#039;t helped by the fact that he doesn&#039;t really know who any of these people are and has probably unwittingly bumped into and vaguely insulted several campus celebrities today already.</p>
<p><strong>13:28</strong> I spy James Croydon.  Lucie: 15. Rich: 0.</p>
<p><strong>13:27</strong> Just heard a wonderful quote in response to a query about drinks: &#039;There&#039;s an outside bar; it&#039;s just outside.&#039;</p>
<p><strong>13:26</strong> I&#039;m now practising said dance move.</p>
<p><strong>13:25</strong> I heard very, very poor singing of &#039;Angels&#039; and thought it was Robbie himself so went running. I was disappointed until I saw the most amazing dance moves on the word &#039;Angels&#039;. Simply stunning. Lucie wasn&#039;t lying. Then they sang the guitar solo. Beautiful. Surely better than Take That&#039;s current tour?</p>
<p><strong>13:23</strong> York&#039;s Got Talent finalists currently on stage are doing a mix of Atomic Kitten and Robbie Williams covers.  The male singer has dance moves to DIE for, but they&#039;ll never be as good as mine.</p>
<p><strong>13:19</strong> OK, it&#039;s definitely not Y&#039;uke Soc. This looks more like Concert Band and they&#039;re currently rattling through a Stevie Wonder number. Foot-tapping stuff.</p>
<p><strong>13:18</strong> There is a man playing mellow things on a keyboard in Vanbrugh Dining Hall.  The crowd are responding accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>13:17</strong> I see no ukeleles though... Hmm...</p>
<p><strong>13:17</strong> According to our copy of the line-up, this is Y&#039;Uke Soc setting up.</p>
<p><strong>13:16</strong> <a href="../../photos/full/7893.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/7893.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>13:12</strong> Rich: Nom nom nom.</p>
<p><strong>13:12</strong> Burgers have arrived!</p>
<p><strong>13:11</strong> D&eacute;ja vu. There he is again. Maybe they&#039;ve changed something in the matrix.</p>
<p><strong>13:09</strong> There is a man with bagpipes currently wandering through Vanbrugh.</p>
<p><strong>13:08</strong> Nick Scarlett spotted! That&#039;s another five points to me.</p>
<p><strong>13:05</strong> Wow Lucie has returned and things are now running five minutes late on both stages. Standards have slipped and quite frankly I&#039;m not sure how the rest of the day can possibly run according to plan. All we need now is a headline slot from Guns &#039;n&#039; Roses... I hear they&#039;re very reliable these days.</p>
<p><strong>13:04</strong> A big cheesy shout-out to Pete and Hannah, our editorial predecessors, who live-blogged here with us last year. We miss you.</p>
<p><strong>13:02</strong> On the plus side, Lucie has taken the camera so who knows what treasures she will bring back...
I&#039;m also informed that we&#039;re going to be getting some videos up on here at some point too. This is new territory for us so I hope you appreciate that we&#039;re going out on a limb with this new-fangled technology.</p>
<p><strong>13:01</strong> Now they&#039;re late.</p>
<p><strong>13:00</strong> Lucie has ventured off towards the dining hall in search of Y&#039;uke Soc. Apparently the crowd is building in anticipation but they have yet to start. Oh well, it&#039;s not like they&#039;re late yet.</p>
<p><strong>12:56</strong> Note extensive use of smoke machine despite lack of act. Stylish. You just don&#039;t get that sort of entertainment commitment at most festivals these days.</p>
<p><strong>12:51</strong> Lots of things happening in Vanbrugh Dining Hall at the mo...</p>
<p><strong>12:50</strong> <a href="../../photos/full/7891.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/7891.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>12:44</strong> Rich has wandered off to take some photos. I&#039;m playing spot the BNOC.  Just seen RAG Chair Rebecca Irwin, that&#039;s five points to me.</p>
<p><strong>12:41</strong> In case you&#039;re wondering, the first picture is of Rich, and the second is of Lucie. Expect many more pungent sights throughout the day. (Yes, our pictures smell.)</p>
<p><strong>12:40</strong> <a href="../../photos/full/7890.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/7890.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>12:39</strong> We has picturez and textz! Huzzah!</p>
<p><strong>12:39</strong> <a href="../../photos/full/7889.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/7889.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Rich woodstock" alt="Rich woodstock"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>12:36</strong> Can we has both picturez and textz?</p>
<p><strong>12:33</strong> But where are our manners? Before any more Bono-bashing takes place, we must introduce ourselves!
I&#039;m Deputy Arts Editor Rich Powell and beside me is my superior (in many respects), Arts Editor extraordinaire Lucie Vincer.
Photos of us both in hilarious waving poses are currently knocking around our laptops but will hopefully make their way onto your screens any moment...</p>
<p><strong>12:25</strong> The editors are currently arguing about U2. Again.</p>
<p><strong>12:22</strong> Ok. Right. Hello. Welcome to <em><span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>&#039;s</em> Woodstock 2011 liveblog!</p>
<p><strong>12:21</strong> Where have my words gone?!</p>
<p><strong>12:20</strong> Aha!! It lives!</p>
<p><strong>12:17</strong> Hello? Is this thing on?</p>
