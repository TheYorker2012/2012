        <p><strong>23:21</strong> And on that positive note, it&#039;s time for your intrepid Yorker live-bloggers to sign off from this year&#039;s wonderful Woodstock. With this year&#039;s <strong>BOB</strong> winners <strong>Magnapow!</strong> due on the Main Stage within minutes, we&#039;re off to party with the best of them. So long readers, we love you all.</p>
<p><a href="../../photos/full/3693.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3693.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Night" alt="Night"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>23:13</strong> With York blues legends <strong>Hijak Oscar</strong> on the Main Stage, we&#039;ve caught another quick word with <strong>Mike &quot;I&#039;m really pissed now&quot; Thacks</strong>. He&#039;s really, really pleased that it&#039;s been such an &quot;awesome&quot; event. Poor guy was almost welling up, bless him. In a live-blogging exclusive for <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>, he revealed that it had raised <strong>absolutely bucketloads</strong>.</p>
<p>Well done Woodstock!</p>
<p><a href="../../photos/full/3701.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3701.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Hijak Oscar" alt="Hijak Oscar"  /></a>
<a href="../../photos/full/3699.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3699.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Mike" alt="Mike"  /></a>

<p><strong>22:48</strong> The mood on the Woodstock site has changed since this afternoon. There&#039;s still a general buzz of excitement, but under the cover of darkness the campus festival-goers have become a bit more raucous (apart from at the <strong>Fringe DJ set</strong>); they&#039;re ready to dance. Good job <strong>Hijak Oscar</strong> is up next on the main stage.</p>
<p><a href="../../photos/full/3696.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3696.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Raucous" alt="Raucous"  /></a>

<p><strong>22:22</strong> We&#039;re reaching that time of night where everyone comes together in front of the Main Stage for that collective musical orgasm that is the final three bands. Away from the alternative <strong>Fringe DJ set</strong> in the Dining Hall, most of us are enjoying the joyous folk dance party provided by last year&#039;s <strong>Battle of the Bands</strong> winners <strong>Magic P and the Innuendos</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="../../photos/full/3695.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3695.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Magic P &amp; the Innuendos" alt="Magic P &amp; the Innuendos"  /></a>

<a href="../../photos/full/3694.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3694.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Night" alt="Night"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>22:14</strong> As the fire juggling continues, a staff juggler appears, along with more poi.</p>
<p>The outside is darker now, and that makes it all the more impressive.</p>
<p>The fire poi, a set of chains with flaming balls on the end, are flung around the head of the quite frankly crazy, yet undeniably highly skilled, juggler.</p>
<p>A fire extinguisher has also appeared alongside the jugglesoc sign; a bad sign or just a precaution? I have heard of fire jugglers being singed before, but most seem skilled enough in their technique to avoid most harm.</p>
<p>However, flaming paraffin is not something you want to treat disrespectfully. At least these guys know how it&#039;s done though.</p>
<p><strong>21:28</strong> Fire juggling has started!</p>
<p>There will hopefully be more to come, and in greater variety, but the first taster of flaming fun was pretty excellent.</p>
<p>Fire poi, skipping with a flaming rope/chain, and juggling between two people are amongst the first firey acts to come our way.</p>
<p>If other people within <strong>JuggleSoc</strong> show up later, we may see more poi and staff manipulation - with added flames.</p>
<p>We shall see. It&#039;s obvious though that the darker it gets, the more impressive the flames will seem.</p>

<p><strong>21:23</strong> The festival goes on... There&#039;s a bit of a musical lull outside as the mainstage prepares for the next act. But us Yorkerites are still blogging hard.</p>
<p><a href="../../photos/full/3679.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3679.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Yorker Live Blogging @ Woodstock" alt="Yorker Live Blogging @ Woodstock"  /></a>

<p><strong>21:08</strong> <strong>Tin Pan Valley</strong> are currently taking the main stage by storm, getting our feet itching and our bodies bopping. Their set featured the hilarious &#039;Relationships&#039;, a pared down version of lead singer Mark Perkins&#039; hit &#039;Barry&#039; as performed last year by Porcelain Flamingo. Their penultimate song was their only cover. Pulled off in style, they gave a crowd-thrilling rendition of the Guns &#039;n&#039; Roses classic, &#039;Night Train&#039;.</p>
<p>Next up: <strong>Death Defying Life</strong> followed by last year&#039;s headliners <strong>Magic P and the Innuendos</strong> at the main stage, and DJ sets by <strong>Fringe Society</strong> and <strong>Rob Marlahan</strong> at in the dining hall.</p>
<p><strong>21:00</strong> The Vanbrugh toilets are now like toilets at any festival; overused, undercleaned, and usually suffering from a severe queue.</p>
<p>Try not to drink too much boys and girls.</p>
<p><strong>20:54</strong> <strong>Michael &quot;MT&quot; Thacks</strong> just passed by again, perspiring with excitement. He claims that he&#039;s &quot;trying to get out of comp&egrave;ring&quot;, but we think it&#039;s just a excuse to hang out with <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>. We caught this cheeky snap of him proving how much fun he&#039;s having...</p>

<p><strong>20:48</strong> News just in from nearby revellers: &quot;Idle Jack were awesome&quot;. So there you have it, folks, Woodstock is just getting better and better. Still to come, <strong>Tin Pan Valley, Magic P and the Innuendos, Hijak Oscar</strong> and <strong>Magnapow!</strong></p>
<p><strong>20:34</strong> We just enjoyed a visit from none other than Woodstock 2009&#039;s headlining act <strong>Magnapow!</strong> This moment is, in the words of Jonny Simms, &quot;two years in the making,&quot; who quips that he has been trying to headline woodstock with a band of his own since his university beginnings. The band seem wired for their impending performance, though claim to be a little nervous too. The set will feature <strong>Magnapow!</strong> classics and a medley, along with the new tune &#039;Tyrannosaurus FX&#039;. Described by the band as being &#039;bass-y&#039; and &#039;fast&#039; this seems sure to be a floor-filler. Apparently, the first performance even provoked audience participation: &quot;We didn&#039;t suggest it, they just couldn&#039;t help themselves,&quot; jokes Simms.</p>
<p>The big MJ couldn&#039;t escape this conversation: vocalist Ben Crawley tells me the band have been bombarded with Michael Jackson cover propositions, but Crawley seems less than keen. Who knows what will happen on the night? Only you will when you get yourself over here, that&#039;s who.</p>
<p><strong>20:29</strong> Now, here&#039;s the thing. <strong>Man is Slapped</strong>, concluded the JCR Stage lineup in great style. Starting out with the kind of subtle electronica Maps is famous for, the one-man laptop band from Jersey ended up beatboxing and covering the theme from the <em>Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</em>. Without doubt, one of the highlights of today: while <strong>Idle Jack &amp; the Big Sleep</strong> was out playing to the masses, the Slapped Man was a great &#039;been here 8 hours already&#039; chill-out opportunity. Most importantly, this was our first sight of a Michael Jackson commemoration, &#039;Rock With You&#039; getting a sample at the end of <strong>Man is Slapped</strong>&#039;s legendary &#039;MySpace song&#039;.</p>

<p><strong>20:24</strong> It&#039;s over 8 hours in and the atmosphere is still electric, thanks to fresh revellers arriving to enjoy the evenings musical entertainment.</p>
<p>And of course, we keep on blogging.</p>
<p><strong>19:53</strong> Oh. My. God. <strong>Falling Leaflets! Step Away?</strong> have just performed and have proved that, despite their zeal for punctuation, they can knock out some pretty funky beats!!! How much stage presence do you reckon a band who uses a Gameboy as an instrument has??? Quite a lot, is the answer...</p>
<p><a href="../../photos/full/3671.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3671.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Falling Leaflets. Step Away?" alt="Falling Leaflets. Step Away?"  /></a>

<p><strong>19:30</strong> If you were at Glastonbury right now, you would find there to be nobody on the Pyramid Stage, the Other Stage or in the John Peel Tent. Here, however, we have <strong>Little Jimmy&#039;s Flaming Funk Orchestra</strong>, <strong>Down With the Kids</strong> and <strong>Hot Toddy</strong>. That&#039;s an awful lot of variety compared to Glasto, isn&#039;t it?</p>
<p><a href="../../photos/full/3669.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3669.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Little Jimmy" alt="Little Jimmy"  /></a>
<a href="../../photos/full/3668.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3668.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Down with the Kids" alt="Down with the Kids"  /></a>
<a href="../../photos/full/3672.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3672.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Hot Toddy" alt="Hot Toddy"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>19:19</strong> Just spoken with Alistair Dicky from <strong>Tin Pan Valley</strong> who said &quot;Word up homies! I hope all you doggs are ready for a tippin&#039; show! We are going to lay some rockin&#039; tunes down! Also wanna say that I love Nick Connell the most out of all my housemates&quot;. Make sure you check him, and the rest of the band, out on the main stage from 20:40.</p>
<p><strong>19:16</strong> So, it&#039;s come that time of the day; the dining hall stage is showcasing the bands with weird names. First up, <strong>The Spoon? (and the)</strong>, with an undoubtedly energetic set. The front man, seemingly a carrot-topped Thom Yorke-Jarvis Cocker hybrid, is highly entertaining to watch.</p>
<p>Next up, <strong>Falling Leaflets! Step Away?</strong> with some funky electro beats, apparently.</p>
<p><a href="../../photos/full/3667.jpg"><img src="../../photos/userimage/3667.jpg" height="64" width="53" title="User Image not found" alt="User Image not found"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>19:03</strong> <strong>The Shambles</strong> concluded with some brilliant dinosaur themed sketch material.</p>
<p>Fantastic. Well worth watching.</p>
<p><strong>18:43</strong> Back at <strong>The Shambles</strong>, the crowd is getting cheeky; but their suggestion of an improvised naked-restaurant sketch was quickly rejected. Thankyou...</p>
<p><strong>18:37</strong> <strong>N*Sink</strong>, Derwent&#039;s victorious act from <strong>YGT</strong>, have experienced a minor technical problem on the main stage. But it&#039;s OK, they&#039;re keeping the (surprisingly large) crowd entertained with an off the cuff version of &#039;Total Eclipse of the Heart&#039;.</p>
<p><a href="../../photos/full/3666.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3666.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="N*Sink" alt="N*Sink"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>18:36</strong> <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> editor&#039;s quote of the day:</p>
<p>&quot;If you thought hip hop was dead, Dreamz just killed it&quot; - <strong>Oliver James Hutchings, The Shambles</strong></p>
<p><strong>18:22</strong> At <strong>The Shambles</strong>&#039; show:</p>
<p><em>Keremy Jile - My Alternate Personality Cheated on Me</em></p>
<p>The willingness of the performers to change personalities and introduce curious concepts makes The Shambles an exciting group.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have noticed that she looked a lot like my sister when I slept with her; but I&#039;m blind in my right ear...&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>18:16</strong> <strong>The Shambles</strong>&#039; second performance of the day is underway in V045. A more familliar environment than the JCR they were assigned for their performance earlier, it seems to show in their performance.</p>
<p>As usual, the same mix of enthusiasm and genius runs through their performances, and the considerably larger crowd is responding well.</p>
<p>&quot;How did you get here?&quot; &quot;I came on an animal of sorts...&quot; made the crowd roar with laughter.</p>
<p>This is a must see. Come along and watch before it&#039;s over! The latest sketch is Keremy Jile... this could be good!</p>

<p><strong>18:13</strong> In celebration of passing the halfway stage of our reporting, here&#039;s an exclusive (provided you aren&#039;t aware of the Central Hall stairs) look at Woodstock from above.</p>
<p><a href="../../photos/full/3662.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3662.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="from Central Hall" alt="from Central Hall"  /></a>
<a href="../../photos/full/3663.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3663.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="from Central Hall" alt="from Central Hall"  /></a>
<a href="../../photos/full/3664.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3664.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="from Central Hall" alt="from Central Hall"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>18:00</strong> Tom Scott just dropped by. He&#039;s having a &quot;fun time&quot;, and is especially fond of the jugglers. Not that he&#039;s showing favouritism, he&#039;s also &quot;danced like an idiot&quot; to some of the bands outside. Go dance some more, Tom!</p>
<p><strong>17:55</strong> <strong>Gurmeet Singh&#039;s Percussion Buffet</strong> are owning the Paradise area right now, rhythmically banging away like there&#039;s no tomorrow. Selby loves you, guys.</p>
<p><a href="../../photos/full/3661.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3661.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Gurmeet Singh&#039;s Percussion Buffet" alt="Gurmeet Singh&#039;s Percussion Buffet"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>17:49</strong> A man and a ukulele are bound to provide good entertainment. Add a sweet-voiced backing singer, a keyboard and a double bass, and you&#039;re definitely in for a good time. That&#039;s what the audience just experienced in the dining room with <strong>Nihad Gomez-Cehic</strong>. Very melodic.</p>
<p><a href="../../photos/full/3660.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3660.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>17:46</strong> Woodstock this year seems to have struck a chord with the festival-goers.</p>
<p>One first year while passing our blogging team in Vanbrugh said:</p>
<p>&quot;I have been here five hours and I intend to be here for another seven, because I&#039;m really enjoying everything here.&quot;</p>
<p>And from the size of the queue for the stage in the hall that&#039;s true of many others too.</p>
<p><strong>17:22</strong> Part of <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> team bringing you this live blog. Come and say hello on your way to the bar.
<a href="../../photos/full/3658.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3658.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Woodstock Live Blogging Team" alt="Woodstock Live Blogging Team"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>17:20</strong> Breaking news: the outside bar is out of pints. A passer-by, Martyn Williams, was heard to exclaim: &quot;I&#039;m really pissed off.&quot;</p>
<p>More on that when we get it.</p>
<p><strong>17:16</strong> Someone nearby wants a MASSIVE penis. A Massive BLUE penis. On her face.</p>
<p>Overheard, once again, near the Student Action facepainting area.</p>
<p>Maybe Mike can pass on a few of his condoms...</p>
<p><strong>17:15</strong> Bumped into Mike &quot;Thacks, I organised this party&quot; Thackray again, he gets everywhere! This time he&#039;s proving he stays extra safe AT ALL TIMES with a handy packet of condoms. He&#039;s obviously expecting a lot of love.</p>
<p><a href="../../photos/full/3657.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3657.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Mike condoms" alt="Mike condoms"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>17:02</strong> Just overheard from the facepainting station:</p>
<p>&quot;I will not paint a penis on you.&quot;
&quot;Why not?&quot;
&quot;Because I won&#039;t.&quot;</p>
<p>Good for you, student action volunteer!</p>
<p><strong>17:02</strong> If we were at Glastonbury now, we could be watching Pete Doherty or Dizzee Rascal. But we&#039;re far away at Woodstock watching <strong>Frankenstaines</strong> and eagerly awaiting the arrival on the Main Stage of <strong>Make It Better Later</strong>, and all the better for it, we might add.</p>
<p><strong>17:00</strong> Food available until 10pm in Vanbrugh today includes a classic burger and chips with salad and sauces, for &pound;3. Very worth the money.</p>
<p><strong>16:53</strong> Souvenirs are selling well - playlist lanyards, masquerade masks etc. Face painting is also still available in Vanbrugh bar, courtesy of Student Action.</p>
<p><strong>16:51</strong> The outdoor crowd are having casual fun in the warmth - although the bands are not proving as popular as the indoor acts, hence the horrendous queue through Vanbrugh&#039;s catering area.</p>
<p>Still, the music provides an ideal soundtrack to a warm and beer-riddled afternoon on Vanbrugh beach.</p>
<p><strong>16:49</strong> The Cast of <strong>High School Musical</strong>, set to hit campus in Week 5 of next term:</p>
<p><a href="../../photos/full/3654.jpg"><img src="../../photos/userimage/3654.jpg" height="64" width="53" title="User Image not found" alt="User Image not found"  /></a></p>

<p><strong>16:40</strong> With the queue for the canteen stretching all the way to Hull, here are a few shots of the happy festival-goers enjoying the Vanbrugh Paradise mid-afternoon breeze:</p>

<p><strong>16:38</strong> First Woodstock fail! James college&#039;s <strong>YGT</strong> entry hasn&#039;t turned up for her second performance in the JCR. Some have suggested it&#039;s an artistic tantrum for not coming first, but we couldn&#039;t possibly speculate. Nevermind though, plenty of other good acts to get through.</p>
<p><strong>16:18</strong> Vanbrugh&#039;s <strong>Chris and Amelia</strong> are on stage again in the JCR, starting off their set with a crowd pleasing rendition of &#039;Isn&#039;t It Ironic&#039;. The small crowd seems thoroughly entertained by their soulful tones.</p>
<p><a href="../../photos/full/3648.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3648.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Chris and Amelia" alt="Chris and Amelia"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>16:05</strong> <strong>PoleSoc</strong> have just amazed the crowd with their flexibility and strength. Spinning and sliding around that pole is no easy task when you are supporting your entire body weight with just your thigh muscles.</p>
<p>The group also involved a number of both male and female performers, all of whom were excellent, and fantastic to watch.</p>

<p><strong>16:03</strong> We just caught up with festival organiser Mike Thackray who seemed to be in his element: &ldquo;The weather&rsquo;s holding out which I&rsquo;m really pleased about,&rdquo; and while he told us they had had a couple of technical glitches earlier on in the day, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re all ironed out now.&rdquo; It certainly all seems to be running smoothly from where we&rsquo;re sitting. Vanbrugh has been converted to a summer festival haven overnight: The Pimms is flowing, faces are painted, tasty treats and tipples are passing our envious eyes in others&#039; hands, clothes rails are overflowing with the vintage, the beautiful and the quirky, and students have turned out in their best festival get-up, ready to let the good times roll. In other words, if you&rsquo;re reading this, STOP and get yourself over here, pronto.</p>

<p><strong>15:43</strong> We&#039;re in the middle of a great <strong>Dancesport</strong> presentation of Latin and Ballroom standards. The group performances of the cha cha and the samba just flew by, making way for a spellbinding duo samba.</p>

<p><strong>15:35</strong> Well done to the <strong>DramaSoc: Reduced</strong> guys for their brilliant version of <em>A Midsummer Night&#039;s Dream</em>.</p>
<p>The crowd outside near the main stage is growing - it&#039;s a good day for a beer on Vanbrugh Paradise with some interesting music!</p>
<p><strong>15:15</strong> &quot;He raped his girlfriend, cheated on his other one, and then... took them to Wetherspoons!&quot;</p>
<p>Ah, <strong>DramaSoc: Reduced</strong>... truly surreal.</p>
<p>Some more random quotes from their performance:</p>
<p>&quot;Booyah! He shall be MINE!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Treat me like a dog or something... woof woof?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is important to note at this point, ladies and gentlemen, that some things are much better than being killed by your true love... these things include the London Symphony Orchestra, melted ice, and eating your own toenails.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>15:09</strong> We&#039;re enjoying <strong>Zamar Gospel Choir</strong>&#039;s performance in the Dining Hall at the moment. Great singing with classic spirited gospel choir movement. Gospel on one stage, Shakespeare (of a sort) on another, and <strong>Arctic Fury</strong> due on the Main Stage any minute: Woodstock&#039;s proving to be a triumph in diversity so far today.</p>

<p><strong>14:57</strong> Out at the Main Stage, <strong>Turnip Fury</strong> are giving a nice performance to a crowd of barbecue-savouring revellers. Relaxing times during a humid afternoon on Vanbrugh Paradise.
<a href="../../photos/full/3635.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3635.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Revellers" alt="Revellers"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>14:53</strong> Results are in! Derwent&#039;s <strong>N*Sink</strong> have won <strong>York&#039;s Got Talent</strong>!</p>
<p>Closely followed by James&#039; Alana Burchett in second and Vanbrugh&#039;s Chris and Amelia in third place.</p>
<p>Well done all who took part!</p>
<p><em>A Midsummer Night&#039;s Dream</em> by <strong>DramaSoc: Reduced</strong> is on in a few minutes... something different, and worth a look.</p>
<p>Now, let&#039;s say hello to Nicola and Anna, joining our team of bloggers for the next couple of hours. Hello Nicola and Anna!</p>
<p><strong>14:43</strong> The Hornets do not disappoint! Well done to York&#039;s cheerleaders for an excellently energetic and highly watchable performance!</p>

<p><strong>14:38</strong> It&#039;s all excitement in the Dining Hall as we await the <strong>York Hornets</strong> performance.</p>
<p>And here we go...</p>
<p><strong>14:36</strong> With <strong>YGT</strong> performers collecting all the coppers people are willing to give, the Dining Hall just saw a stunning performance from <strong>GymSoc</strong>, streamers, hula hoops and gymnasts flying gracefully through the air.</p>
<p><a href="../../photos/full/3631.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3631.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>14:13</strong> <strong>The Shambles</strong> have just started off in Vanbrugh JCR - and it&#039;s quite a crowd for such a small room!</p>
<p>Their reputation as competent comics preceeds them; and it seems like they won&#039;t disappoint.</p>
<p>It&#039;s all a bit predictable in some ways; but their slot is young! Go along and fling some audience suggestions at them, and see how they are handled - they won&#039;t let you down!</p>
<p><a href="../../photos/full/3632.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3632.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>14:03</strong> Keri from Wentworth has just been up as the last <strong>YGT</strong> contestant - and what a finish!</p>
<p>Her cabaret style number complemented her voice perfectly, and the judges and the crowd loved it all.</p>
<p>Results out after <strong>DanceSoc</strong>&#039;s next number! Stay tuned!</p>
<p><strong>13:52</strong> A solo now from Amelia, and her voice quality is really bringing home the song. It&#039;s tricky switching from a Grease number to Dolly Parton - but she&#039;s doing it fantastically!</p>
<p><strong>13:49</strong> Vanbrugh contestants Chris and Amelia strike up an immediate rapport with the crowd as &#039;You&#039;re the One That I Want&#039; from <em>Grease</em> becomes audible, and we all clap along to one of the most well known songs you could choose to do as a pair.</p>
<p>Nice costumes guys! Nothing like a bit of cheese!</p>
<p><strong>13:45</strong> Meanwhile, the Main Stage is rocking - but I would advise those with tender ears to approach with caution!</p>
<p>Well done too to <strong>Jugglesoc</strong> who are adding a splash of colour to outside. They&#039;re well known for their fire-juggling, so we shall see if we get any flames from them later on.</p>

<p><strong>13:43</strong> Back at the Dining Hall Stage, Becca from Langwith is strumming her heart out for the audience. Another powerful voice, she&#039;s making a good job of her chosen song and the audeince are enthralled.</p>
<p><strong>13:43</strong> Away from <strong>YGT</strong>, the Main Stage area has seen an early show from <strong>Revelation Rock Gospel Choir</strong>, giving an impassioned performance that did a great job of lighting the flame for the day of partying ahead. Their up-beat set featured lots of gospel classics, including &lsquo;Somebody to Lean On&rsquo;, &lsquo;Wade in the Water&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rejoice, Rejoice&rsquo;.</p>
<p><a href="../../photos/full/3627.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3627.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Revelation Rock Gospel Choir" alt="Revelation Rock Gospel Choir"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>13:40</strong> Representing James, Alana Burchett&#039;s lovely voice and acoustic guitar is a million miles away from Sean&#039;s air guitaring. The crowd&#039;s a bit on the noisy side, but a cover of Gnarls Barkley&#039;s &#039;Crazy&#039; is the right way to go. Great response from the crowd, great stuff all round!</p>
<p><strong>13:27</strong> Draped in sheets, James and his backing singers take to the stage.</p>
<p>&#039;Any Dream Will Do&#039; floats across the hall...</p>
<p>AND OFF FLY THE SHEETS! Showing three nicely dressed girls and James in his maroon jacket and headband.</p>
<p>&#039;We Will Rock You&#039; is belted out across the hall. Crowd-based clapping accompanies it. He&#039;s a little out of time, but once again enthusiasm carries him through the fear and he gives a good performance...</p>
<p>Again more air guitar... after he dives off the stage of course!!!</p>
<p>And the judges liked the novelty. As they should!</p>
<p>Well done James from Halifax!</p>
<p>Next up, James... the college.</p>
<p><strong>13:20</strong> More talk of passion.</p>
<p>The judges loved his interacting with the audience... but they&#039;re right, he&#039;s not the best to be here today.</p>
<p>Next up, James from Halifax.</p>
<p><strong>13:16</strong> &#039;Give it up for Goodricke!&#039; yelled Sean...</p>
<p>And so they did!</p>
<p>Sean&#039;s &#039;Livin&#039; on a Prayer&#039; is fuelled by passion and self-confidence; and even the judges are miming along. He&#039;s not the best singer I have heard come through <strong>YGT</strong>, but the air guitar is gutsy and his gestures are big.</p>
<p>&#039;It&#039;s My Life&#039; is now belting out of the speakers, and I&#039;m starting to wonder if Sean needs that microphone with a voice that powerful and that much enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Go Sean!</p>
<p><strong>13:11</strong> Our judges seem happy again - competition is hotting up.</p>
<p>Next on stage, Sean from Goodricke.</p>
<p><strong>13:08</strong> Derwent&#039;s N*Sink guys have the crowd screaming less than thirty seconds in - like it wasn&#039;t hot enough in here!</p>
<p><strong>13:05</strong> <strong>York&#039;s Got Talent</strong>! first up, for Alcuin college, is Eric doing a Bob Dylan number on his acoustic guitar. The crowd like it, and the judges are impressed by his &#039;passion&#039;. Well done Eric.</p>
<p>Coming up next: Derwent.</p>
<p><strong>12:52</strong> <strong>DanceSoc</strong> has just put in a fantastic performance of salsa, street and other styles. The crowd really got into their smooth moves. A great way to kick off in the main hall!</p>
<p><a href="../../photos/full/3624.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3624.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="DanceSoc" alt="DanceSoc"  /></a></p>
<p><a href="../../photos/full/3621.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3621.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="DanceSoc" alt="DanceSoc"  /></a></p>
<p><a href="../../photos/full/3625.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3625.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="DanceSoc" alt="DanceSoc"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>12:48</strong> The action&#039;s well and truly underway, with <strong>DanceSoc</strong> taking to the stage in Vanbrugh Dining Hall. A decent crowd is surrounding some pretty impressive performances (check back for videos later on) ahead of the final of <strong>York&#039;s Got Talent</strong>, starting in a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>12:02</strong> Welcome to <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>&rsquo;s live coverage of Woodstock 2009!</p>
<p>We will be talking you through what promises to be a fantastic festival.</p>
<p>Already we can hear musicians warming up, as tech support, bouncers and first aid volunteers roam the site. The hornets have already appeared ready for their performance later, and guitarists prowl Vanbrugh anxiously awaiting show time.</p>
<p>Bring on the entertainment!</p>
<p><a href="../../photos/full/3617.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3617.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Before Woodstock" alt="Before Woodstock"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>11:18</strong> Can&#039;t make it to Woodstock today? No worries, you can read reviews and comment on each act right here throughout the day. Whilst you are here, why not tune into URY and listen to all the acts live?</p>

<p>Just to clear things up: DramaSoc Reduced is a different group of people from DramaSoc that did all 25 plays from this academic year in an hour for an ODN this term. We were in fact just DramaSoc members doing Midsummer Night&#039;s Dream. Well done to all at Woodstock!! You were all fab! Thanks!</p>
