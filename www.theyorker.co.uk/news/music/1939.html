		<div class="SubText">So has my own college James got talent? I dragged two more housemates to the event to assess the situation.</div>

        <p>I should at this point announce that we were late in our arrival. For a valid reason - we were supporting the Student Action play - and drinking ros&eacute;. However, we arrived, just as a twosome were eating donuts. Being a relatively pissed group of young ladies, we were impressed.</p>
<p>The judges took the form of James Chair, Chet Khatu, RAG President, Helen Adams and Woodstock Co-ordinator, Billy Goldring, whilst Alex Fink took to the stage once more as compere.</p>
<p>However, the bits we missed were; Chris Russ, who was due to be the warm-up at Goodricke five days ago. He was described by James Chair, Chet Khatu as &quot;a talented guitarist&quot; who added &quot;I look forward to seeing him at Woodstock&quot; and Act 1.</p>


<h3> Act 1 </h3>

<p>The donut eating.</p>
<p>That&#039;s almost enough to write about this, but I feel I should add that it was race. There were two of them. It was Lewis vs. Theresa. He beat her by 7 minutes. Now that is talent.</p>


<h3> Act 2 </h3>

<p>We&#039;d arrived by this time and were set to see a double act of Charlie Barclay and Felicity Moore.</p>
<p>Charlie Barclay announced: &quot;This is the keyboard solo, so appreciate it&quot; to rapturous applause.</p>
<p>Laura, my ever lovely companion said; &quot;I like it&quot; and to be honest she needs some convincing, so they should be pleased.</p>
<p>Whilst the female mic was considerably louder than the bloke&#039;s, she did show her talent. &quot;She&#039;s a bit of a Whitney&quot; was another one of Laura&#039;s descriptions. I believe this sums it up; great effort but the acoustics of Wentworth didn&#039;t really lend it. To be fair, I do think they&#039;d perform better on stage at Woodstock than in Wentworth.</p>
<p>Adams said: &quot;I&#039;m really impressed with the original material. Really good. Congratulations&quot; whilst Goldring said: &quot;It&#039;s really hard to know what to say. In terms of raw talent you&#039;re up there with what I&#039;ve seen in any other college. In terms of preparation...&quot; he left it at that, and we agreed.</p>
<p>He added: &quot;Fliss you were really awesome. Charlie, the last time I saw you you were in Girls of Prey. Number one, prepare and then I&#039;d like to see more!&quot;</p>
<p>Khatu said: &quot;Flick, I had no idea you could sing so well, so well done!&quot;</p>


<h3> Act 3 </h3>

<p>Alex Fink: &quot;This is for charity, I don&#039;t normally do this, but to be honest, it&#039;s becoming more frequent.&quot;</p>
<p>In a turn of the tables Khatu asked Fink, what was his inspiration? &quot;My inspiration was when I saw you earlier Chet.&quot;</p>
<p>Fink went for the karaoke classic <em>Don&#039;t stop me now</em> and went for the old audience participation approach, and yup, we  certainly did participate</p>


<h3> Act 4 </h3>

<p>Felicity, opened with a note that not only stopped me typing, but stopped housemate number 2 texting, and numbers 3 and 4 stop eating the Party Rings we had left over from the picnic.
She was sultry jazz at its best - the only criticism we had was that she was too good for a talent competition. Fliss had great tone, diction, got a standing ovation - and had amazing shoes. She has our respect.</p>
<p>She was speechless when asked how she felt her performance had gone. Adams added: &quot;That was really great. Great song, and something a bit different.&quot; Whilst ever-lovely Billy Goldring said: &quot;That was insane. I&#039;m just upset that I haven&#039;t seen you in the last three years singing around York&quot; (cue a loud round of &quot;aw&quot; from the audience)</p>
<p>Goldring added: &quot;I&#039;m speechless&quot; and the praise continued from Khatu &quot;that was amazing.&quot;</p>
<p>Moore was modest in her review of her performance: &quot;I can&#039;t really hear myself, so I don&#039;t know how it went!&quot;</p>
<p>During our chat we discovered she was the new resident in my old room. Moore also admitted: &quot;I&#039;d forgotten I&#039;d get judged!&quot;</p>


<h3> Act 5 </h3>

<p>Next up we had some keep-uppy action from Mark Johnson. Hypothetically an amazing talent, although a few seconds in nerves took hold and he lost the ball - whilst his co-pilot accidentally kicked the ball into the crowd (in his defence he was holding a pint). The pair took it in turns to hold the pint - and it seemed to be whoever held it, missed it. However, when concentrating they were talented, although we won&#039;t lie, we were a little disappointed.</p>
<p>Even they admitted that they thought they&#039;d improve if they got through, Goldring asked: &quot;My housemate did 930 the other day, what&#039;s your record?&quot; They hit back: &quot;Can he do it with a pint in your hand?&quot; They got him. &quot;Touche&quot; responded Goldring.</p>


<h3> Act 6 </h3>

<p>Marcus Stewart, said he wasn&#039;t ready to wow the audience, thus not filling us with optimism. He did however take to the stage with confidence, and he seems to be doing some form of stand-up (yes, I am writing this live) He carried on to explain his dilemna of eating a burger, in a wet box (despite no rain) in the midst of Viking Raid. The long story short? He did eat it. Then the punchline - &quot;I reached in my pocket, and pulled out a five pound note&quot; We didn&#039;t laugh, the audience didn&#039;t. Sorry mate, we&#039;re not convinced.</p>
<p>Laura&#039;s verdict? &quot;This comedian&#039;s making me depressed&quot; we agreed. We shall therefore leave that acts review there.</p>


<h3> Raffle Interlude </h3>

<p>We were offered the choice of a home-cooked dinner, two dates and a teddy bear.  Anna, our housemate (who has never won a raffle in her life before) went for Chet. Well in.</p>
<p>Laura, my other housemate, took a date with Alex. The girls have it going on! Well in again.</p>


<h3> Act 7 </h3>

<p>He said he&#039;s nervous, and it&#039;s stiff competition, he strapped on his guitar and took his place on stage. Here goes James Coope for <em>The Killers Mr Brightside</em>. It was a version like no other, slightly higher than normal. In my un-educated musical mind, I&#039;m going one or two octaves, but it was certainly different. It got applause. We went to the bar.</p>
<p>The second song was much improved, we loved it. It got praise from the ladies; one housemate said &quot;I love it&quot; whilst another one said &quot;I actually really like it&quot;. Praise indeed. We returned to our seats.</p>
<p><strong>Reviewers Choice</strong></p>

<ul><li>Fliss

</li><li>James Coope
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Judges Choice</strong></p>

<ul><li>Fliss and Charlie

</li><li>James Coope.
</li></ul>
<p>Our verdict. We had fun, we won on the raffle. The talent was much more plentiful than when we lived in the college (this time, puns are intended) but the last word has to go to Helen Adams who summed the evening up as &quot;original&quot;. Amen to that sister.</p>
