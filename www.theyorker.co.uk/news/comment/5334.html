		<div class="SubText">Well hello and a premature welcome to The University of York! My name is David Pocock and I&rsquo;m the Satire Editor of The Yorker. I&rsquo;m writing to tell you just how easy it is to join the ranks of satire writing on campus! What follows is the general procedure for taking on new writers. Have a quick read and I hope you give it a go!</div>

        <p><strong>Stage 1</strong></p>
<p>Submit a formal written application of no more than 5000 words (we recommend 3000 &ndash; 4000) to myself including at least 2 references from editors of publications that you have previously written for. The application should detail your experience, journalistic achievements and why you feel you would suit a role in satire at <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>. A cover sheet should be included.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 2</strong></p>
<p>If you reach stage 2 then well done! Only 20% of applicants do so! This achievement makes you eligible to submit the second stage of you application, namely, a portfolio of pieces you have had published. We recommend including between 30 and 40 articles.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 3</strong></p>
<p>Applicants that impress at stage 2 will be interviewed by a panel of very intimidating suited and booted campus journalists. The interview will include an IQ test, a short written exam and a spelling test in addition to the questions the panel will ask.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 4</strong></p>
<p>Selection! If you impress at interview and have an IQ high enough to get into Mensa (148+) you have a decent enough chance at becoming a satire writer for <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>! You will be notified whether you have been successful 3-5 months after the interview.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t panic, this is of course a bunch of crap. If you fancy having a crack at writing satire, drop me an email! It&rsquo;s dmp503@york.ac.uk. I&rsquo;m always looking for new writers and would love for some freshers to get involved! You can either ask me questions on the email or simply send me a piece you have written! No experience whatsoever is necessary and I will be more than happy to help and publish budding satire writers! Enjoy the rest of Summer and see you in Freshers&rsquo; Week! You might want to check this out too:</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>1) Please point out the pretension, I&#039;m at a loss.<br />
2) Whilst you&#039;re at it, point out where I can get a copy of The Lemon Press on campus, I haven&#039;t seen one for over a year. Not that I&#039;ve looked for one after the first I read.<br />
3) How dare you use <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> as a means of advertisement for The Lemon Press.</p>

<p>I saw three issues of the Lemon Press on campus last year - they were everywhere. Where have you all been hiding?<br />
Who cares if their website looks a bit shoddy? The mag itself looks good and the content is great!</p>

<p>I agree with #7 that the shoddy website doesn&#039;t matter too much. But the comments of #1 and #2 are pretty unfair and inappropriate. Perhaps they didn&#039;t &#039;get&#039; the article? Quite ironic I suppose...</p>

<ul id="CommentItem9715History" class="comment_edit"><li>Wed, 1st Sep 2010 3:19am - Edited by the author</li></ul><p>This article is ridiculous. Now that&#039;s not really the author&#039;s fault, more <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>&#039;s for having a section dedicated satire when York has The Lemon Press, which the NUS thought was the best student publication in the country in the past year (and The Lemon Press&#039;s first year), including newspapers such as Nouse and Cambridge Varsity, who were beaten in the &#039;final&#039;. This article is ridiculous because it completely ignores York&#039;s official satire magazine. David Pocock - you can get a copy of The Lemon Press around campus - Vanbrugh, Langwith, James - supposedly five times in the coming year. If you want precise instructions I&#039;d suggest becoming a fan on facebook or keeping an eye on the website. But where can I get a copy of <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>? Oh that&#039;s right, it&#039;s only available online, between periods of down-time. Furthermore it isn&#039;t even a society. Yes The Lemon Press&#039;s website may be a bit amateurish, but they&#039;ve only existed for a year compared to <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>&#039;s several, and they produce a magazine as well. How dare the first commenter use <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> to advertise The Lemon Press? They wouldn&#039;t have had to had you mentioned it. But regardless of that, doesn&#039;t <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> purport to be a tool with which York&#039;s student union societies can publicise their activities? I believe it does and suggest you read through some of your own web pages.</p>

<p>A little harsh from the first two posters, but I&#039;ve no idea how David can have a go at TLP as a publication, in terms of its circulation and its quality, especially since he&#039;s only (purportedly) read one issue. To disregard your competition is such a ridiculous thing to do. Especially when that competition has won a major student media competition. Looking green-eyed and sounding monstrous.</p>

<p>Some of the commenters here need to chill out. David appears to be just trying to spark some interest for the Satire section at <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> - and there&#039;s no problem in doing that, surely? #9 - your criticism of <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> was kind of un-called for and I think it&#039;s clear that there&#039;s absolutely no need for this article to mention The Lemon Press... as the purpose of it is to attract attention for <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>&#039;s own satire section, not somebody else&#039;s!</p>

<p>#11: I couldn&#039;t agree more.</p>
<p>Let&#039;s analyse this people...</p>
<p>I am the editor of the satire section of <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>. I wrote an article to spark interest in it for the freshers joining us shortly so the section can grow and become more of a presence in campus satire. I don&#039;t see a problem with this in the least. Then... Someone (presumable officially representing rival publication The Lemon Press) comments on the article telling people &#039;not to waste their time on this&#039; and also plugging said rival publication. Come on guys. Yes part of <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>&#039;s aim as a student publication is to raise awareness of societies and opportunities in every area on campus, but as #11 quite rightly said... Where&#039;s my obligation to mention the Lemon Press in my article?! I most certainly shouldn&#039;t be criticised for not doing so.</p>
<p>So <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>&#039;s satire section is not established anywhere near the extent that The Lemon Press is. Shouldn&#039;t we all be supporting each other though? Not posting petty and childish comments like #1 and #2. I&#039;ve not noticed The Lemon Press mentioning the fact that <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> has a new satire section.</p>
<p>As far as I&#039;m concerned, #2, that was uncalled for and inappropriate, and as such has been reported as abuse.</p>
<p>I think this pettiness should come to an end now people. Thank you to everyone who showed an interest in the article. I guess the criticism is kind of ironic because the article was designed to attract attention in the first place. Job done.</p>
<p>As an editor of <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> I trust the publication will support me in this matter.</p>
<p>I wish everyone involved in a satirical publication on campus the very best of luck this year <img src="../../images/smileys/smile.gif" alt="" />. We&#039;re all trying to achieve the same things after all guys...</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>David Pocock (Satire Editor)</p>

<p>So The Lemon Press is a very light hearted and unpretentious publication? I&#039;m afraid that doesn&#039;t come across when it so clearly feels entitled to a monopoly on campus satire writing and gets bitchy with another publication for the astonishing crime of promoting itself on its own website.</p>
<p>Prior to this episode I wouldn&#039;t have known enough to comment on TLP&#039;s working environment, but from this brief taste it sounds like they were taught in the Blair-Campbell school of administration and PR. Frankly guys, you&#039;re not doing yourselves any favours. <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> may not be a society, but it certainly sounds less obnoxious than TLP.</p>
<p>#9 The reason why you can&#039;t pick up a copy of <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> is because it is a website, not a paper publication. Try to keep up.</p>

<p>I think when an article promises to explain how to become a satire writer at York, you would assume it would mention TLP. The article doesn&#039;t immediately come across as just an explanation of how to get invovled with <span class="theyorker">the yorker</span>, it seems to deny TLP&#039;s existence. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s more ignorance than malice though. To the people talking about monopolies, satire isn&#039;t really the same as news. It&#039;s quite a specialist area. Yes York has quite an extensive media, but it might make sense for everybody interested in something like that to group together rather than having a little bit all over the place. But as the author says, he has done well to attract attention. I can&#039;t remember the last time <span class="theyorker">the yorker</span> had more than a couple of comments on a story.</p>

<p>How does the article deny TLP&#039;s existence? By not mentioning it? Ridiculous! I suppose <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>&#039;s news, sport and arts sections also deny the existence of Vision and Nouse, because they omit mention of those publications which also have news, sport and arts sections?</p>
<p>And this isn&#039;t an article about how to become a satire writer AT YORK, but about how to do so at <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>! That&#039;s why it is featured on <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>! Durrrrr.</p>

<p>I&#039;ve been looking at the Lemon Press&#039; FB page and I don&#039;t see any information whatsoever about writing for it. It seems a tad elitist to be honest. Hats off for the award TLP, but I&#039;d rather write for a more friendly up-and-coming, accessible satirical publication which doesn&#039;t pick fights with rivals.</p>
<p>And I&#039;d also like to say how PREPOSTEROUSLY RIDICULOUS I find it that the author of this piece is accused of not acknowledging TLP when he&#039;s the editor of a &#039;rival&#039; publication publishing at article ON HIS OWN PUBLICATION&#039;S WEBSITE. I just can&#039;t put into words how pathetic I find this. It&#039;s actually made me quite mad and I&#039;ve got nothing to do with it! I have to know... Was it a joke? Is this thread satire as someone suggested? Because I seriously struggle to believe that anyone could be so utterly moronic. Also... I&#039;d LOVE to know if commenters 1 and 2 are officially affiliated with TLP. If so... My word. I think it makes them even more pathetic. And unprofessional. If they really do represent TLP, like I said, I for one would like to know. Not names, but a yes or no...</p>
<p>And I also find it rather amusing that this article has attracted so much attention. Hello guys!! This is exactly what the author was trying to do! Good job I say I found the article funny and a real hook to look into writing for <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>. How many Lemon Press articles have 19 comments?! Hahahaha.</p>
