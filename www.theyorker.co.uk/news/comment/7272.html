				YUSU Awards 2011 - meaningful?			</div>
				<div class="Date">Friday, 10th June 2011</div>
		<div class="Author">
			<a href="../archive/reporter/616/index.html">Guest Writer</a><br />
		</div>
		<div class="SubText">Written by Alan Belmore.</div>

        <p>What is the point of the YUSU Awards? This is the question that hit me as soon as I read about the announcement of the nominations in <span class="theyorker">the yorker</span>.</p>
<p>I am sure we can all agree with that sentiment. There is a plethora of groups and individuals who have done a lot to help their fellow students. Be it someone giving up their time to help with Nightline or providing help as a STYC to someone who has a particularly tough transition from home to University, these people should rightly be praised and rewarded by the Students&#039; Union for their work.</p>
<p>However, it is surely a sign of complacency and laziness on behalf of the Students&#039; Union if they feel the best way to achieve this is to run this awards night. If you want to award STYCs who have done a good job, then surely it would be better to host a reception for the no doubt 20-30 STYCs who have really shone out this year? And with the importance of CV-enhancing, some sort of title could go along with it &ldquo;Outstanding work as a STYC&rdquo; or suchlike. To try and choose one person as the &ldquo;best STYC&rdquo; simply belittles the dedicated and varied work of a number of students who have gone beyond the call of duty in aiding first years.</p>
<p>Whilst I recognise that this is an example, I believe that this is an issue spread across all of the categories that recognise &ldquo;worthy&rdquo; individuals. And this not the only problem. Many of these titles seem to have been made up for the sake of having an award, rather than actually being something worth rewarding.</p>
<p>The prime example of this seems to be the &ldquo;Campaign of the Year&rdquo; title. Rather than displaying the best campaigns student have to offer, it seems to display the dearth of campaigning on campus. Nominated for this award is the Great York Sit In: only at a University could sitting in a building, singing a few songs and making some demands count as a campaign. Alongside this we see the Islamic Awareness week, which I don&#039;t doubt provided some interesting events which widened peoples horizons, but once again to describe a week full of events as a possible &ldquo;Campaign of the Year&rdquo; rather goes against my idea of a campaign, which is a long standing commitment to a cause. However worthy these events, a week of action does not make a campaign. It is one of many examples where a requirement for recognition is non-existent.</p>
<p>The reality is that this event makes a mockery of itself. Instead of providing meaningful recognition to those who have gone out of their way to help the student body, the Students&#039; Union has turned the event into a circus. By trying to name a &ldquo;best STYC&rdquo;, &ldquo;outstanding community volunteer&rdquo; or &ldquo;course rep of the year&rdquo;, YUSU fails to recognise the multiple people who have contributed a significant amount of time and effort to helping others by striving for a &ldquo;winner&rdquo;. In addition, awards such as &ldquo;Greg Dyke Award for Contribution to the Student Media&rdquo;, &ldquo;Most Developed Society&rdquo; and &ldquo;Campaign of the Year&rdquo; simply seem to exist for existence sake, rather than displaying the efforts of those who selflessly give their time and effort to helping others.</p>
<p>I am not against the notion of competition; those who know me will tell you I am one of the most competitive people they know. But the idea of competition for the sake of competition is not a worthwhile pursuit. Recognition does not have to be a glitzy award ceremony, and YUSU&#039;s attempt to copy the Oscars highlights once again its detachment from ordinary students. Let&#039;s provide recognition to those who deserve it, not attempt to arbitrarily pick a &ldquo;best&rdquo; from a varied and often incomparable field. And if you do insist on choosing the &ldquo;best&rdquo;, don&#039;t turn it into a circus by providing meaningless awards.</p>

<p>&quot;only at a University could sitting in a building, singing a few songs and making some demands count as a campaign.&quot;</p>
<p>So I guess something like the Greensboro sit-ins during the Civil Rights movement are equally deplorable? They were peaceful and it stood for something, same as the York Sit-in. &#039;Campaign&#039; may not be the best word to use, but students have full time degrees on their minds. I felt the York sit-in was a worthwhile cause (and no I didn&#039;t take part in it).</p>
<p>Furthermore, how on earth does an award like &#039;Most Developed Society&#039; &quot;exist for existence sake.&quot; It&#039;s an award for those in a society who have dedicated time and effort to expand and improve something they are interested in and that they enjoy. Besides, if students wanted to put their work for a society on their CV, they will. Winning a student award, realistically, isn&#039;t going to be a gamechanger, whether it&#039;s called &quot;best styc&quot; or &quot;outstanding work as a styc&quot; or whatever.</p>
<p>The YUSU awards are a bit of fun - something your cynical, whinging article seems to miss.</p>

<p>Belmore&#039;s right on the sit in campaign, it&#039;s insulting to compare it to the Greensboro sit-ins. The sit in at uni was a pitiful display and disruptive to other people!</p>

<p>Haha, what?  Is your entire argument &quot;awards are bad because they pick one person from the many&quot;... (all those ceremonies are awful). Chill out, comrade, maybe you&#039;ll be nominated next year.</p>

<p>Anon 1 here. You&#039;re right Michael, I just meant that sit-ins have purposes, whatever their nature, and I think it&#039;s ridiculous to dismiss them like Alan has. He might as well have said &quot;bloody hippies taking up space.&quot;</p>

<p>The point of the YUSU Awards is to reward people who&#039;ve gone that extra mile, and the societies who&#039;ve shown best practice and offer the most to their members.</p>
<p>In what way do the awards you&#039;ve mentioned &quot;exist for existence sake?&quot;.</p>
<p>If you&#039;re not happy with the shortlisted events/people then you really should have bothered to put some nominations forward yourself.</p>
<p>Also, why is it that <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span> put a comment piece like this up, but make no effort to get a comment piece arguing the alternative view? Any chance of balance?</p>

<p>Annonymous 1- I was referring to this sit-in which was sitting in a building, singing some songs and making some demands. It was very different to the Greensborough demonstrations which helped change the perceptions of an entire nation. That&#039;s why it&#039;s a mockery to call the York sit-in a campaign.</p>
<p>Robin- You&#039;ll see I don&#039;t argue against competition, just competition where it&#039;s not appropriate. It&#039;s quite easy to choose the best football player on a pitch. It&#039;s quite easy to choose the best singer out of a line-up. But choosing a &quot;best STYC&quot; from people who&#039;ve supported others in a variety of ways? My argument isn&#039;t that competition should never exist, just that there are better ways of recognising those who have given a lot to the student body than just picking one &quot;best STYC&quot;.</p>
<p>Nick  - The problem isn&#039;t the nominations though, as I say it&#039;s the categories. Why have a &#039;Campaign of the Year&#039; award when its clear by the nominations that there isn&#039;t really anything to go in that category? Most developed society an award defined as &quot;exceeding expectation in commitment to the society&rsquo;s development&quot;, superb management guff, how does one develop an expectation on how committed societies should be to development? Why are societies existing and taking YUSU money if they aren&#039;t totally committed to development?</p>
<p>Might I suggest you take this opportunity to provide an alternative point of view Nick - blogs@theyorker.co.uk. It would be a great contribution to the debate.</p>

<p>WomCom&#039;s &#039;Reclaim the Night&#039; was an excellent campaign, and is also nominated, as is another of their campaigns. This cannot fall foul of your strict criteria for what constitutes a &#039;campaign,&#039; and runs every year. So...</p>

<p>Apologies, I should have phrased that differently. I agree that the campaign was successful, but why have an award for &quot;best campaign&quot; when there was only one recognisable campaign on campus (I purposly haven &#039;t commented on that campaign so far as I don&#039;t have much knowledge on it)? It seems to me to only highlight that there is a dearth of campaigning on campus, rather than celebrate the success of the student body.</p>

<p>Just re-checked; Reclaim the night is nominated under a &#039;welfare&#039; nomination, rather than the &#039;campaign&#039; category. My bad!</p>

<p>The Awards take place tonight, with several hundred people in attendance.</p>
<p>Hopefully of <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> choose to cover it again they&#039;ll do so with a positive spin, recognizing the hard work people put in rather than belittling them.</p>

<p>I don&#039;t think you can say this is &quot;<span class="theyorker">the yorker</span>&quot;&#039;s coverage; after all, the writer doesn&#039;t even have a byline, so he mustn&#039;t have written for them before.  I&#039;m sure if someone had written a more positive opinion piece and sent it in, it would have been published alongside this one.</p>
