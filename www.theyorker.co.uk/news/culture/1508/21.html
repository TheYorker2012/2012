		<div class="SubText">I am going to be entirely honest here. The premise of Fusion originally did not fill me with an endearing passion or prompt a heart-warming grin. I could not see past the seemingly cringe-worthy nature of privileged people modelling in underwear, raising funds for causes vastly unconnected to the glamourous outfits adorning the beautiful bodies on show. </div>

        <p>However, after seeing the show I am predictably eating my words, although eating <em>anything</em> after that skinny-minnie extravaganza will be guilt-ridden.</p>

After seeing the show I am predictably eating my words, although eating <em>anything</em> after that skinny-minnie extravaganza will be guilt-ridden.
<img src="../../../images/prototype/news/quote_close.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
<br /><span class="author"></span>
</div></blockquote><p>This year the full title for the event was &lsquo;Fusion in Motion&rsquo;. Incorporating varying genres from the silver-screen, the choreographers co-ordinated spectacular sequences utilising various societies from across the university. Fusion is certainly an apt term for this event and I think this is what closed the deal regarding its legitimacy.</p>
<p>The event showcased the university&rsquo;s extraordinary talent with performances from Dance Society, Pole Exercise, Dance Sport and the Japanese Society, to name but a few. Fusion successfully pulled together the outstanding skill on offer without making it seem a mish-mash type affair.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<img src="../../../images/prototype/news/quote_open.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
Creating a whole new society which should probably be entitled &lsquo;Hot Soc&rsquo;, the event epitomised its name this year.

<br /><span class="author"></span>
</div></blockquote><p>Although the charity aspect is undoubtedly Fusion&rsquo;s winning asset, even without this the sheer empowering spirit of the links made between societies makes the event worthwhile. Creating a whole new society which should probably be entitled &quot;Hot Soc&quot;, the event epitomised its name this year.</p>
<p>Early on, there was a western sequence which served the purpose of telling the girls watching: there are hot guys in York (Shock. Horror.) Although the homo-eroticism made it hard to refrain from shouting &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, the boys worked their bodies to perfection.</p>
<p>Some notably interesting sequences included the horror and pole-dancing sections with some incredible athleticism, well-styled quirky outfits and dancing which straddled both appropriate modesty and sultry naughtiness simultaneously.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<img src="../../../images/prototype/news/quote_open.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
The whole thing was amazing to do. We all have fun and I think it shows.
<img src="../../../images/prototype/news/quote_close.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
<br /><span class="author">Tom Rogers</span>
</div></blockquote><p>As well as the numerous mass group performances, there were some notably talented individuals that deserve a mention. Michelle Ndebele, joint lead choreographer, should get a huge medallion-style award for both her co-ordination and dancing abilities.She shone her way through numerous performances with a professional quality that demanded the question: how have you not been snapped up by Sylvia Young?</p>
<p>Jo Gledhill, the other joint lead choreographer, demanded the same question due to her dynamic and edgy quality that served to reinforce her elegance in a section performed to the beautiful <em>Kissing You</em> from Romeo and Juliet. Performed with the hugely talented Tom Rogers, this section was a definite highlight as its subtlety contrasted the dynamicity of many other sections. Rogers said of the event: &quot;The whole thing was amazing to do. We all have fun and I think it shows.&quot;</p>
<p>Stealing the show however were the Ghostbusters: Anton Murphy, Lionel Owusu, Michael Batula and Ike Ogbodo. This comic foursome epitomised what the event was about with their beautiful bodies, skilled dancing and superb comic-timing. These guys could make fun of themselves, making their sections notably endearing.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<img src="../../../images/prototype/news/quote_open.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
If you are even slightly sceptical, go and get converted as the excellently selected soundtrack gets you jiggling in your seat.

<br /><span class="author"></span>
</div></blockquote><p>Some sections seemed to slightly undermine the genuine ability of most of the event however. The lingerie section in particular was slightly cringe-worthy in that this exemplified the criticised perceived premise of the show; a chance for the &lsquo;beautiful-ones&rsquo; to showcase to the rest their aesthetic superiority.</p>
<p>For the rest however, Fusion made for hugely entertaining viewing. Enough with the gushing superlatives though; just go tonight to support Cancer Research and local charity SNAPPY. If you are even slightly sceptical, go and get converted as the excellently selected soundtrack gets you jiggling in your seat. You may just eat your (calorie-counted) words.</p>
<p>To buy a ticket for tonight&#039;s showing, please go to the <a href="http://www.yusu.org/events/event.html?id=1566">YUSU website</a> and a limited number are still available from Your:Shop.</p>

<p>The majority of criticisms of this years Fusion is that is wasn&#039;t as good as last year. This article draws no comparison with previous years, i think this article is good review if it is from someone who hasn&#039;t seen previous Fusion&#039;s. The Nouse article seems overly negative to me calling the event &quot;terrible&quot; at times. Also it took me a good few minutes to find it from its homepage, it needs a better layout!</p>

<p>I agree with above. This year&#039;s event was an occasion in itself. It had a generous atmosphere and gave to good causes, there is no need for pointing out of minor negatives when the event was brilliant overall. You&#039;d think that the student media would want to support its peers as they worked so hard.</p>

<ol><li>22, it is also interesting how much of the student media is involved with the show.
</li></ol>
<p>One of our dear Yorker eds. was a tech for it, i know a couple of people from Nouse that were in it... i find the coverage of it suprisingly fair with that in mind</p>

<p>At the end of the day I think people need to remember what Fusion is all about. It is the only show on campus that strives to integrate numerous societies, dancers (who we should remember are not professional and are not studying dance full time) and models (who for many this was their first experience on stage) all in the name of raising money for charity. As somebody that was Musical Director of last years show and danced in this years I&#039;m not going to get into the Nouse comparison arguement but I think that the show should be allowed to stand alone without having to follow the conventions of previous years. This years team made some brave decisions like getting rid of the compares (the best decision ever!!) and also chosing to include more humour and alternative dance styles such as tap and contemporary. Ultimately though Fusion is about a group of students giving up vast amounts of time to raise money for charity and I think the student media should start showing them some support.</p>

<ul id="CommentItem1839History" class="comment_edit"><li>Sun, 2nd Mar 2008 9:38pm - Edited by the author</li></ul><p>I think it quite funny that all you people telling the writer to be nicer, would be the same ones to criticise if she had been perfectly nice all the way through! The show was fantastic, and it was well done, and for two great causes, but there were aspects, such as the lingerie that were a bit unnecessary and this was reflected by the audience atmosphere of little giggles by male members and once conversation between female members about the actual lingerie - an odd silence ensued. But well done to all involved, it was a geniunely impressive spectacle!</p>

<p>It seems from the fact that there was a link to the YUSU website at the bottom of the article that this was intended to be a promotional piece as a worthy cause was witnessed, rather than the account Nouse gave. Each to their own I say but it is nice to read a positive review occasionally.</p>

<p>I don&#039;t think anyone&#039;s trying to disparage the effort, the cause or the quality of individual performers. However, as with any other event on campus (i.e. the Musical, Drama Barn plays, Gilbert and Sullivan, Pantomimes etc.), a review is entirely within its rights to be critical, and should be objective and realistic.</p>
<p>Personally I think it&#039;s important to recognise the amazing efforts of the people involved in Fusion - which everyone seems to have done. However, if every review was based on the effort put in then almost everything would get a 5* rating - which is not an accurate representation of the quality of the show.</p>
<p>To ignore Fusion&#039;s shortcomings is unfair to both those involved and the audience, and Fusion should be supported for being a worthy cause, but should not be given a special status, exempt from criticism.</p>

<p>Whatever your opinion of Fusion post #25 was right it was all for chairty, and a lot of people gave up alot of their time to make it happen.</p>
<p>While i agree that all performances should be reviewed and if necessary criticised, these criticisms should stick to the performance itself and its quality not to the nature of the people involved and certainly shouldn&#039;t be making judgements about those people as anything other than performers in a show.</p>

<p>I was &quot;anon#10&quot;, and to clarify I wasn&#039;t being sarcastic I was being deadly serious. I think it was a careless remark that was unnecessary and should not have been there. Having seen Fusion myself last night after posting the comment, the scene in question was in no way homo-erotic [I expected groping or something by what was said in the article!]; no less homoerotic than the lingerie scene or say what every sports team on campus do in the changing rooms every time they practice.<br />
I&#039;m not trying to be militant [or slating the article] I just hope that <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span> will start taking more consideration over what it lets slip through the proverbial net.</p>

<p>Alex, my mistake in falsely assuming it was sarcasm or irony - I made assumptions from the way the comment was worded that I perhaps shouldn&#039;t have.</p>
<p>To use an example, I think everyone can agree that Top Gun is quite an homoerotic film (and also, for the record, *frikken awesome*), yet there&#039;s no groping or overt homosexual acts in it, just a bunch of guys playing volleyball and flying planes.</p>
<p>Personally Alex, I think you&#039;re taking political-correctness too far, or misunderstood the what (perhaps) the intended meaning of the word &quot;homoerotic&quot; in this article was.</p>

<p>Just to clarify... my post at number 25 was intended to criticise the overly negative and inaccurate review that Nouse have released on their website- they called Dance Soc, Spanish Soc for gods sake! I wasn&#039;t intending to level any criticism towards Kirsty&#039;s review here as she balances criticism whilst remembering the spirit behind Fusion as a whole. Although I agree with Amy that Fusion should not be above artistic criticism I do also feel that trashing the efforts of so many students all for charity isn&#039;t helpful. Fusion&#039;s slogan is after all &quot;Music, Fashion and Dance&quot;  so maybe it&#039;d be more appropriate for Nouse to send a reviewer who enjoys watching Dance or at least has a basic knowledge of dance styles (someone who doesn&#039;t confuse flamenco with ordinary tap). Either way, whatever people thought of the show, a large number of students should be very proud at raising such a large amount of money for two great charities.</p>

<p>To be honest it was more the thing about &quot;shouting Brokeback Mountain&quot; that irritated the most. I consider myself quite reasonable in the political-correctness states [I&#039;m not the most PC of people! haha], this one just hit a nerve. Just an example of what a friend put as &#039;hetero-normality&#039; i.e. hot guys are there only to be admired by girls. I don&#039;t think it was malicious, just thoughtless.<br />
And I&#039;ve not seen Top Gun [shock horror]. Although I&#039;ve seen that Will Young video that takes the piss out of it [hello sterotype - haha].</p>

<p>Yes perhaps thoughtless, however just a flippant comment with no disrespect intended at all. I didn&#039;t shout it of course, I know that that would be completely inappropriate.</p>
<p>Mitch was right...it was homoerotic simply because of the connotations westerns hold at the moment due to aforementioned film. No negative connotations in association with the film, westerns (or cowboys in general)just hold that particular association at the moment and I, in my excitable state, had to *childishly* refrain from expressing my thoughts.</p>

<p>I love what Fusion stands for but I have to admit that I was rather disappointed with this years performance after seeing the show last year. Again, the &#039;wow&#039; factor was missing and I didn&#039;t like the fragmented songs and performances. The urban theme and the inclusion of dance into the modelling scenes worked so much better last year. The cinema theme tried to include too many styles which didn&#039;t seem to flow as well. The Gostbusters scene was fantastic though, well done boys!!</p>
