		<div class="SubText">Immigration is an issue close to my heart, indeed, as the intuitive amongst you may have realised, my surname isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t British. Half of my family are Polish. </div>

        <p>Five years ago that statement would not have attracted a response. Now there is a definite silence, a knowing look, and an even more knowing &lsquo;Oh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I recall an ideological discussion with my (then) boyfriend about how, in his opinion, I was different from most immigrants because my grandparents had fled Nazi Poland.  My argument, was, and still is, that there are many immigrants in this country who have fled equally horrendous a fate in their own country and surviving the Nazis doesn&rsquo;t make my family a special case.</p>
<p>My Grandma, the youngest of six, was just 12 when her entire family was forced from Poland in 1939. They were, however, incredibly lucky. They not only made it out of Russia on the last transport but all her five siblings, both parents and grandparents survived the war, and met again once more.</p>
<p>We are an incredibly lucky family.</p>
<p></p>

<br /><span class="author"></span>
</div></blockquote><p>That is not to say that England was where they wanted to be. They were Poles: they wanted to be in Poland. My great grandparents and grandparents always harboured the expectation that they would return. It was not until 1963, despite the family having lived here for 15 years, and my Dad being 7 years old that he was taught the English language. Not because of any intention to keep him Polish, but because he would not need English when - <em>not if</em> - they returned. Then the communist government took charge and they never returned. Today, Poles coming to this country do not even view themselves as immigrant, but as &ldquo;nomads&rdquo; or &ldquo;commuters&rdquo; waiting to return home.</p>
<p>Whilst many immigrants are no longer fleeing war, there are still other, largely ignored, reasons: a weak economy to begin with. Many Poles that I know, either personally, or indirectly, come to England for work. Indeed, with (until recently anyway) wages in Britain four times that of Poland (but with higher living costs) young Poles made their way to England, found a job for a year or two, made a decent amount of money and returned to their families. Many were leaving children, partners, wives, girlfriends, behind. Their sole motivation? To secure a better standard of living for their families. Who are we to fault this? To me, it&rsquo;s an admirable quality.</p>
<p>Quite simply there are more opportunities, and more money in England. A TV programme the other week showed a group of unemployed Brits, who, when offered a job for &pound;7 an hour as a butternut squash picker for Tesco turned it down and said it was below them. Meanwhile their Polish compatriots jumped at the chance to earn the wage, despite the work being lengthy, back-breaking and uninteresting. Whilst here they work incredibly hard, working long shifts and living in far from ideal conditions &ndash; up to 8 in a 2-bed house &ndash; they go through this because they want to maximise the money they earn in the shortest time, so they can return quicker.</p>
<p>Yes, some have stayed. Just as some Brits have stayed in the British Empire.</p>

</div></blockquote><p>Whether you agree with immigration or not, to say that you would rather an individual live in fear, or suffer in a country for whatever reason, rather than offer refuge in this country genuinely diminishes my hope in humankind.</p>
<p>Having grown up in West Yorkshire, lived through race-riots and various other racial tensions, I find it interesting - humourous -  to hear the same people who once hurled racist insults towards Indian and Pakistani residents,  muttering instead: &quot;bloody Poles!&quot; They still find a way to complain about Jan, the Polish electrician who will come out at whatever hour, and charge less than Jeff down the road.</p>
<p>After all, as a commentator pointed out, it is the least paid workers who are losing out as the competition is at the bottom of the food chain, although a lot of the profits are being made at the top.</p>

</div></blockquote><p>Despite the last 800 words I have written, I do not intend to change your mind about immigration. I am simply eternally thankful for Britain being somewhere safe for my own family to come after a perilous journey. I do, after all, identify myself as British. I was born here, as were my siblings and my parents, and, although this causes me much embarrassment at times, I am an English football fan, although I will always check the Polish result too.</p>
