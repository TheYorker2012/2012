				Hillary, a reason to celebrate?			</div>
				<div class="Date">Saturday, 24th November 2007</div>
		<div class="Author">
			<a href="../archive/reporter/270/index.html">Emily Cousins</a><br />
		</div>
		<div class="SubText">The 4th November. It doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t sound much like a hallowed date in history. I doubt it has ever appeared on a cereal-packet-freebie detailing the key chronological turning points of the last few centuries. Next year though, one of my friends turns 21 on this day. After the huge generosity and kindness I was fortunate enough to have bestowed upon me this week for my big two one celebrations by the Cousins Party Planning Committee, I have been musing about possible repayment schemes on the festivities front. </div>

        <p>So imagine my excitement when I realised that one of the integral organisers of my birthday extravaganza shared her special day with the 2008 American Presidential Election. What, after all, says happy memories better than a themed Republican-Democrat colour coded shindig? I&rsquo;m thinking a guest list of 50, each representing one State in the Electoral College. I&rsquo;m thinking a required dress code of costumes that represent the spirit and culture of that particular region of America. I&rsquo;m thinking a wall chart map of the US to be coloured in as votes are counted. I&rsquo;m thinking red and blue bunting, the old classic pin-the-candidate-on-the-political-spectrum and maybe even a sneaky round of pass-the-constitution. The crowning moment of glory would be a tiered cake with the face of the Goddess herself beaming amongst the candles and frosting: Hillary Clinton in patisserie form.</p>
<p>Now, I have been a fan of Hillary ever since she was First Lady really, despite her having quite an army of opposition. She has such clarity of vision and a real sense of social responsibility that is no less effective for being born from true compassion. She took such an active involvement in Bill&rsquo;s legacy and displayed such poise and composure through the scandal and many a something-gate, that it is difficult not to at least admire her even if there is disagreement to her proposals and ideology. Well, there&rsquo;s that, and her selection of real kick ass power suits. I like to think we&rsquo;d be pals; we&rsquo;re friends on Facebook at least, and where does that always lead if not to post Apocalypse-Solving drinks on Capitol Hill?</p>
<p>Many cite the publishing of Hillary&rsquo;s autobiography as being the first platform that showcased her intention to make a possible bid to make history as the first female President. Back before the 2004 election, I was lost in wistful thoughts of a Hillary Clinton / Condi Rice showdown which would ensure this inevitability, but sadly twas not to be. Since then, Hillary has focused on trying to re-claim the middle ground, the swingers and vote floaters, who make or break any election victory. She is running on a manifesto that promises prosperity and reward, strength and nurture. She aims to improve health care, reform government, empower the middle class and family units, and even have enough hours in the day to combat global warming and ameliorate international relations. Aside from making me feel like the biggest underachiever in existence, these propositions also make me feel excited and expectant.</p>
<p>If she gets elected. And if the proposals are subsequently implemented.</p>
<p>There are two potential bubble bursters on the horizon then. Competition wise, for the Democrat candidacy, it&rsquo;s all about Barack Obama and I&rsquo;m a huge fan. He possesses an infectious enthusiasm and steely determination as well as being hugely competent. Policy wise he supports much of what Hillary advocates but possibly has different ideas about how to achieve the desired outcome. After having a large volume of support initially when exploratory committees were announced, he seems to have lost his momentum, and this week Hillary was charging ahead in the opinion polls for the primaries. I&rsquo;d like to see Barack race in the future though: I predict 2020 is his year.</p>
<p>The gloss and polish of a running ticket is all very well if promises are then carried out. Hillary has the politicians patter honed to a fine art and it does concern me that beneath the huge corporate sponsorship and incredible funding power lies a campaign that will fester into oblivion once it is inaugurated into the White House. She does have a shady past with the Iraq War for example. She advocates total removal of troops now, but in 2002 supported the Iraq War Resolution which allowed the President to implement military force. Can voters have confidence that she will not again be fickle on issues that really matter? I can partly exonerate her on this exchange of viewpoint because as senator of New York, I think that after 911 she had more of an obligation to show constituents that some form of pro-active action was being taken to avenge the tragedy and combat terrorism. This does not excuse her supporting a war that should never had been allowed to come to fruition though, but perhaps reminds us that decisions are always politicized and multi-layered.</p>
<p>So there we have it. Just under a year to go and I already have my Hillary for 2008 stickers adorning my bedroom wall. Whatever cynical views people have of Hill and Bill, can I suggest that they are a much better prospect that the dynamic duo, Bush and Babs, who are currently gracing the West Wing-esque power corridors of Western Civilization. Anyway, you must excuse me, I&rsquo;ve now been inspired to sit down with my badge maker and knock off some Hillary merchandise. The funny thing is, I&rsquo;m actually not even joking in any way. I may even start to think about the seating chart for Flatmate B&rsquo;s rave. Would a game of Congress Musical Chairs played out to the chosen campaign songs be too much?</p>
