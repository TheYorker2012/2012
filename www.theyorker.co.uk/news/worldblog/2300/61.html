		<div class="SubText">It&rsquo;s rare that you meet an opinionated agnostic; in fact, some might say that we haven&rsquo;t any opinions at all. Well, they would be wrong.</div>

        <p>An agnostic is a person who believes that nothing can be known about the existence of God. And to me this has always been obvious. How can we <em>know</em> that God exists? We might have strong views one way or another, and I think about such views all the time &ndash; yes, agnostics do think about religion. Arguably they&rsquo;ve thought about it more than anyone.</p>
<p>I was not encouraged to be religious from an early age, and neither was I encouraged not to be. But I&rsquo;ve always taken an immense interest in religion and religious studies was one of my favourite subjects at school. My sister, having barely mentioned the idea, chose to be confirmed into the Anglican Church. I chose agnosticism. My parents, themselves fairly apathetic towards religion, are baffled by us both.</p>
<p>Agnosticism is not an apathetic stance. People who are apathetic on the subject of religion might say, &quot;Well, I guess religion is a nice idea, but I haven&rsquo;t really thought about it, so I don&rsquo;t know if I have a faith or not.&quot; Whereas people who label themselves agnostics have simply had the courage to say, &quot;I don&rsquo;t know if God exists. No-one can know that. But I see many people with strong faith, and just because I personally don&rsquo;t share it, that doesn&rsquo;t make it less valid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, that&rsquo;s all very well,&quot; you might argue, &quot;but you&rsquo;re just sitting on the fence; you&rsquo;re too cowardly to make up your mind.&quot; But I argue that agnosticism is the bravest stance that one can take in the religious debate. In a modern world plagued by doubts in <em>both</em> science and religion, and still wrestling with the immense problem of evil and suffering, to stand up and say, &quot;the evidence doesn&rsquo;t look promising, but ultimately I just don&rsquo;t know,&quot; is surely a brave thing to do.</p>
<p>Many, not all, are driven to accept religion through fear &ndash; to them the alternative of living in a world without certainty, without the faith that there is something better to come, is simply too ghastly to contemplate. Similarly, others take refuge in science, with a capital &lsquo;S&rsquo; &ndash; &lsquo;Science&rsquo;, they claim, has all the answers and if we don&rsquo;t know them today we will do tomorrow.</p>
<p></p>

In a modern world plagued by doubts in <em>both</em> science and religion, and still wrestling with the immense problem of evil and suffering, to stand up and say, &quot;the evidence doesn&rsquo;t look promising, but ultimately I just don&rsquo;t know,&quot; is surely a brave thing to do.
<img src="../../../images/prototype/news/quote_close.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
<br /><span class="author"></span>
</div></blockquote><p>But science doesn&rsquo;t have all the answers: as philosopher David Hume argued, just because the sun rose yesterday and the day before that and the day before that, as far back as we can remember, makes it extremely likely that it will do the same tomorrow, but by no means certain.</p>
<p>I attended a talk earlier this term by the Reverend Lord Richard Harries. He began by stating that intolerance was arguably implicit in any serious world view, and while acknowledging the benefits of engaging in dialogue with people of other beliefs, he did not answer the question which was the title of his talk: &quot;Can religions learn to be tolerant?&quot; I think that religious individuals can be tolerant, and I have plenty of time for agnostic theists, but unfortunately I think that there will always be intolerant people in any society, whether religious or atheist. The reverend considered both religious and atheistic viewpoints, but not agnosticism, a serious world view that leaves most room for tolerance.</p>
<p>After this talk, a friend and confirmed atheist asked me whether I thought the tooth fairy might exist. I said no, I didn&rsquo;t think so. So, he said, God doesn&rsquo;t exist either &ndash; we have no more evidence than for the tooth fairy. Millions of people don&rsquo;t believe in the tooth fairy, but there are millions of religious people in the world. I&rsquo;m not saying that just because millions of people believe in something necessarily means that they are right (and the nature of their beliefs vary tremendously) but I am saying that we can&rsquo;t just dismiss every religious faith outright, especially as some are so incredibly strong and even more have at least been seriously considered. If I&rsquo;ve seriously considered something and so have you, but we&rsquo;ve come to different conclusions, then we both must be prepared to discuss and defend our views. That&rsquo;s tolerance. Bringing up the tooth fairy is funny, but irrelevant.</p>
<p></p>

<br /><span class="author"></span>
</div></blockquote><p>When people ask me about my religious views I tell them that I&rsquo;m an agnostic. I&rsquo;ll probably go on and waffle about the inherently flawed logic in arguments for the existence of God, or about the problem of evil, or about how incredibly fascinating I find Tibetan Buddhism. But they&rsquo;ve probably shrugged their shoulders and walked away. After all, you can&rsquo;t have a discussion with an agnostic, can you?</p>
<p>In a group debate somebody once asked me whether I held strong views about anything. Slightly taken aback and not much of a public speaker, my answer was probably incoherent. But I do believe in tolerance and I do think that agnosticism is itself a strong view - in my opinion, the strongest.</p>
<p>In &#039;&lsquo;Why I&rsquo;m not a Christian&rsquo;&#039;, Bertrand Russell concludes:</p>
<p>&quot;We want to stand upon our own feet and look fair and square at the world &mdash; its good facts, its bad facts, its beauties, and its ugliness; see the world as it is and be not afraid of it.&quot;</p>
<p>This is what I try to do every day, and when I look fair and square at the world I see tremendous complexity. And I&rsquo;m not afraid to admit, after spending much time in thought and discussion, that I just don&rsquo;t know &ndash; I don&rsquo;t have all the answers and neither do you.</p>

<p>String theory is just that at the moment, a theory.</p>
<p>However, it hasn&#039;t claimed to be true, it is still searching for evidence. And it certainly doesn&#039;t tell people how to live their lives and brainwash them.</p>
<p>Is religion searching for empirical evidence of the proof of God and what the bible claims is true?!</p>

<p>It&#039;s just that empirical evidence is simply not in accordance with what the bible claims, so they are just forced to dismiss most laws of nature and go to unbelievable extents to mentally justify the existence of god.</p>
<p>Which is why creationists try to back up their outlandish beliefs with pseudo-science, ridiculous theories such as intelligent-design, helium diffusion and loads of other fabricated bullshit.</p>
<p>Mass delusion. The opium of the stupid.</p>
<p>We really need to start questioning whether the existence of strong religious institutions within a nation is indeed compatible with a democratically organised society.</p>
<p>Is the existence of giant brainwashing corporations feeding on peoples&#039; fears and superstitions in any way contributing towards a better, more democratic society?</p>
<p>If people want to believe in whatever god, let them, but frankly organised religion has absolutely no point whatsoever other than to take advantage of people&#039;s stupidity.</p>

<p>62, I think you&#039;re making extremely angry and sweeping statements that simply aren&#039;t true - whether you believe in any kind of God or not.</p>

<p>Interesting that you would choose to remain anonymous with that remark, #62.</p>
<p>And of course science isn&#039;t compatable with many aspects of God. Of course, we know that science can&#039;t exclude it either. I can&#039;t prove he exists but I can prove he COULD exist. Quantum Mechanics alone dictates a method by which He could act, should He choose to.</p>
<p>Also, most different churches conflict on opinion. I disagree with many things that people at my church say and I disagree with things at other churches too. I wouldn&#039;t really consider it &#039;brainwashing&#039; - brainwashing is using a forced method of changing someone&#039;s opinion... with religion, you choose if you want to. You&#039;re not going to go to church and upon entering be gassed and experimented on, are you?</p>

<p>Sorry Jason, disagree.</p>
<p>Of course God COULD exist, we know (please don&#039;t use QM arguments, you just look silly) that and have never doubted it - see original article.</p>
<p>I think you misunderstand &#039;brainwashing&#039;...of course we don&#039;t mean gassing people.</p>
<p>Einstein once said:</p>
<p>&quot;Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are even incapable of forming such opinions.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#039;s used much more loosely, society is tolerant to allowing a &#039;God&#039; in the loose sense, however that is then being taken further. ID is an attempt to formalise creationsim and that must stop.</p>
<p>And most people don&#039;t choose what they want to, they choose what they THINK they want to. There&#039;s a difference.</p>

<ul id="CommentItem5217History" class="comment_edit"><li>Wed, 7th Jan 2009 11:25pm - Edited by the author</li></ul><p>Some people are dumber than the Vatican, who would have guessed! See quote below:</p>
<p>&quot;The Christian scriptures were written from about 2000 years B.C. to about 200 years after Christ. That&#039;s it. Modern science came to be with Galileo through Newton, up through Einstein. What we know as modern science is in that period. How in the world could there be any science in the Scripture? There can not be! The two historical periods are separated by so much. The scriptures are not teaching science!<br />
It&#039;s very hard for me to accept not just a literal interpretation of scripture but a fundamentalist approach to religious belief. It&#039;s kind of a plague.</p>

<p>I don&#039;t look silly using quantum mechanics as an argument. The point is that the very fabric of the universe is loose and that particles spontaneously disappear and reappear elsewhere all the time. If God manipulated things at a fundamental (particle) level then nobody would notice.</p>
<p>But the argument always draws itself back to God, if he exists, can do anything he wants within or outside of scientific &#039;laws&#039; and if he doesn&#039;t exist science (and its laws) must be absolute and accurate.</p>
<p>And Father Coyne, many of the &#039;sciences&#039; developed by Newton and Galileo were first discovered by the Greeks before the birth of Christ. I agree with your point but I thought I&#039;d just clear that little bit up! <img src="../../../images/smileys/smile.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Things disappear from one point and reappear in a completely different point every second. Reality isn&#039;t smooth; it doesn&#039;t continually move... rather things move erratically and for reasons that are inexplicable to us. Therefore if anything manipulated things at that level we would not notice and yet by the rules of the Chaos Theory, things that small can still have a world-changing effect. You see?</p>

<p>If the people asking questions about how a loving God can permit suffering are interested in some possible answers, I would recommend C S Lewis&#039;s book The Problem of Pain. There are also loads of other books and things online about it - people who believe in God have been struggling with this issue for centuries, but there are answers/theories available.</p>
