		<div class="SubText">I&#039;m pretty sure that most people reading this will have at some point or even regularly used &#039;gay&#039; derisively &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; not as a slur against homosexuals, but as a general term of disparagement. In my case it&#039;s a hangup from my school days that never quite drifted out of my vernacular, which some people might say makes me a homophobe. I don&#039;t believe it does.</div>

<br /><span class="author"></span>
</div></blockquote><p>If I&#039;m using a word and you read it as having a different meaning or take it out of context, then that&#039;s you misunderstanding or just stirring up trouble. OK I don&#039;t know how it feels to be victimised simply because of my sexuality (well, unless being refused entry to a gay club counts) but if no harm is meant, should it be taken in offence? In my mind it&#039;s on a par with calling me a blasphemer if I say &ldquo;Oh my God!&rdquo; It might technically be true and it might cause offence to a minority, but I don&#039;t mean it to and if it did I would consider no longer using it in the presence of those people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&#039;s so gay!&rdquo; - there is a certain intrinsic irony in it that does make it hard to take seriously I think &ndash; how homosexual can an inanimate object be? It&#039;s wide open to being lampooned: <a href="http://www.bustedtees.com/rainbowsaregay">Rainbows are gay!</a> or <a href="http://www.shotdeadinthehead.com/products/info.php?products_id=169&amp;wx=1680&amp;wy=851">Homosexuals are gay</a> t-shirts anyone? If anything using the word in this sense should be ridiculed rather than hated.</p>

<img src="../../images/prototype/news/quote_close.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
<br /><span class="author"></span>
</div></blockquote><p>What started off as a matter of offence to a few in the 70s is now rather a moot point given the current prevalence of usage. Like it or not, the word has changed meaning yet again, not forgetting of course that it used to (and still can) mean carefree amongst many other things. One of the things I consider to be beautiful about language is its constant change. New words come into being, old ones fall out of use. And of course, existing words mutate and change meaning. &ldquo;It&#039;s evolution, baby&rdquo; even if it&#039;s not necessarily of the fittest.</p>
<p>Another thing about this wonderful language of ours, and many others to an even greater degree, is the complete change in meaning that can be made by a change of tone or even undefined, subtle dual-meanings. For example, let&#039;s say someone calls me &quot;nice&quot; - it doesn&#039;t happen very often, but hey, we&#039;re being hypothetical here. I could take that as a compliment, or perhaps I could think they were saying I&#039;m too nice and need to get angry once in a while, or I could think they meant &quot;yeah, you&#039;re a nice guy &#039;n all... but it&#039;s a shame about your face.&quot; In a language where it&#039;s so easy to be misunderstood, surely it&#039;s better to play it safe and assume that no harm was meant?</p>
<p>In 2006 there was minor outrage at the BBC over Chris Moyles&#039;s use of the word (&ldquo;I don&#039;t want that [ringtone], it&#039;s gay&rdquo;). Auntie&#039;s governors eventually ruled that although it might cause offence to a small minority, it is a widely accepted usage. And this is the BBC who generally defecate masonry if someone says &ldquo;crap&rdquo; before teatime. Indeed amongst the other definitions currently in the Oxford English Dictionary lies: &ldquo;Foolish, stupid, socially inappropriate or disapproved of; &lsquo;lame&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If of course you&#039;re one of the people who are still offended by its use in this sense, then hopefully you accept that it&#039;s too late to stop it. Maybe you should consider making your own meanings for words and getting them to spread through your friends - &ldquo;man that party was so fag - I loved it!&rdquo; OK it didn&#039;t work for &ldquo;fetch&rdquo;, but what the hell, it&#039;s worth a shot...</p>

<p>I&#039;ve found that the use of &quot;gay&quot; in a disparaging way comes with a different reaction depending on where it&#039;s being said. In Doncaster, most people had no problem with something being called &quot;gay&quot; and it was banded around merrily. Moving to York, most people kind of understood what I meant, but for those that didn&#039;t, a quick &quot;I meant Donny gay&quot; differentiated it from any negative meaning against homosexuals. Oxford&#039;s a completely different story, and I normally get very disapproving stares/glances for referring to something as &quot;gay&quot;.</p>

<p>My issue with the use of &quot;gay&quot; as a disparaging word comes from my experience of having to put up with it when I was in the closet in school. My experience was not necessarily representative of everyone&#039;s (growing up in a different country and all) but in my school there definitely was a homophobic undercurrent. While things referred to as &quot;gay&quot; were meant to be &quot;bad&quot; rather than &quot;homosexual&quot;, it was clear that gay people were the gayest thing of them all, in both senses of the word.</p>
<p>It didn&#039;t make for a comfortable environment to come out in or to come to terms with one&#039;s sexuality in. Using &quot;gay&quot; in a derogatory sense is at best rude and inconsiderate, but it can also contribute to a climate in which young people feel very uncomfortable with their sexuality and with themselves.</p>
<p>I also wonder what the reaction would be if people used the words &quot;black&quot; &quot;disabled&quot; or &quot;immigrant&quot; as an insult. In fact, I think I&#039;m going to start using &quot;Mitch&quot; as an insult. If anyone asks, I&#039;ll say I mean &quot;York Mitch&quot; rather than a derogatory reference to the real Mitch. People will realise that that&#039;s ok. <img src="../../images/smileys/tongue_wink.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Indeed #4. However, let&#039;s take the completely theoretical case of using Mitch&#039;s first name, Richard, as an insult. Let&#039;s consider a theoretical case where Richard, like many other Richards, wanted to use the common one-syllable substitute for Richard, &#039;Dick&#039;, and then some unscrupulous person decided to turn his first name into an insult, &quot;Oh, he&#039;s such a dick&quot;. Turning a name into an insult sounds crazy, no?</p>
<p>As with the dual-use of &#039;gay&#039; as a term for homosexuals and a general derogatory term, the difference is context. If you call something &#039;gay&#039; you&#039;re not implying homosexuals are bad, any less than you&#039;re implying all Richard&#039;s are bad when you call someone a &#039;dick&#039;.</p>

<p>I think that&#039;s more to do with the fact that school kids are cruel, unforgiving dicks and high school is just one massive popularity contest, Matthew. &quot;Kids are animals, civility is learned behaviour.&quot;</p>
<p>The difference between &quot;gay&quot; and other words you suggest is that through decades of widespread use in this way it already has a different meaning and in another decade it may be used exclusively in the new sense. Just as I&#039;m sure &quot;spazz&quot; and &quot;spacker&quot; are and will continue to become less offensive over the years simply through their prevalence of use among kids who don&#039;t know any better.</p>
<p>BTW, nice example with &quot;dick&quot;, Chris. <img src="../../images/smileys/smile.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>I knew you&#039;d say this, and I knew it would piss me off.</p>
<p>The problem is, people who do not give the impression of being 100% straight are still subject to prejudice of the worst kinds, discrimination, and even violence, which is not true of people called Richard, or of Christians in this country. So the comparison is completely flawed.</p>
<p>If civility is learned (something I am not convinced of - there are strong arguments for the innateness of empathy. Maybe being cruel unforgiving dicks is learned?) then that is not a reason to go on saying &quot;gay&quot; and not having a problem with it. Surely the reverse is true - civility towards marginalised groups must be consciously promoted, because the social norm is to stigmatise these groups. Until this marginalisation is so historic that disabled people and queer people face no greater difficulties in life than people called richard, I will continue to find derogatory use of words like &quot;gay&quot;, and &quot;spacker&quot; as well, oh and &quot;chav&quot; too, A Bad Thing.</p>
<p>That is all for now.</p>

<p>It&#039;s incredibly easy for straight kids to say, &quot;Oh, we don&#039;t mean it like that.&quot; (Which is not to say that anyone who isn&#039;t straight will have the same view on it, since I know people who aren&#039;t bothered by this usage of &#039;gay&#039;.)</p>
<p>Also, when someone starts complaining about political correctness, the words &quot;straight white male&quot; often applies to them.</p>

<p>This article is ridiculous. Camilla has pretty much the nail on the head.</p>
<p>Using gay as a slur rather than as a descriptive term is why people (justly) find it so insulting.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other slurs that are completely unacceptable within society which could be seen to (implicitly) attack aspects of people&#039;s identities, yet &#039;gay&#039; doesnt seem to be one of them - it should be.</p>

<p>I had to think long and hard about my response here, there are a lot of very convincing words above...</p>
<p>Firstly, I never said it was a good thing or something to be condoned. Merely commented that its use is commonplace, unstoppable, ridiculous and does not necessarily make the speaker a homophobe. Personally I try and avoid using the word in this sense but it does slip out now and then in moments of frustration (insert innuendo here).</p>
<p>I was very keen to avoid using those fateful words &quot;politically correct&quot; in the article - I&#039;ll leave Clarkson to bitch about that (not that he is representative of my views in <em>any</em> way) - but you&#039;re right Rose, this is certainly a long way from &quot;political correctness&quot;. There is a possibility for offence to be caused but in most cases it is completely unintentional.</p>
<p>Then again it&#039;s a lot easier to not cause offence in the first place than to say something and apologise for it later.</p>

<ul><li>slaps head*
</li></ul>
<p>Oh this argument comes up all the time and the problem is it&#039;s just a pile of poo.</p>
<p>Let me rephrase, gay is NOT playful banter in most schools. (If you happen to have been to one of those nice schools where you can climb trees or do finger painting instead of PE, then maybe things are different, I wouldn&rsquo;t know&hellip;) In most comprehensives the use of the word gay in a &#039;oh that subject&#039;s so gay&#039; way and &#039;he&#039;s a dirty gay I&#039;m gonna kill him after maths&#039; way is pretty blurry. Ask a 13 year old what gay means, and you are very unlikely to get a friendly &lsquo;oh it&rsquo;s just this funny ironic little thing we say when we&rsquo;re rather miffed&rsquo; more likely a simple &lsquo;well it&rsquo;s gay, it&rsquo;s rubbish, dirty, like gays innit&hellip; duh!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now I understand that most of the nice middle class girls and boys out there are just trying to be down with the street and probably mean no harm against their lgbt friends. Still I have nothing against Pakistani people but then I don&#039;t refer to the local Indian takeaway as a &#039;paki restaurant&#039;. Nor do I jokingly point at a friend in a wheelchair and say, &lsquo;hurry up spaz&rsquo;. Whether or not I mean it as a friendly jape the fact of the matter is for about 80% of the country (world?) &lsquo;gay&rsquo; is no jape...</p>
<p>Words have meanings, and yes, meanings do change, but please don&#039;t patronise people who probably know a lot more about what the word &#039;gay&#039; really means (from direct experience) by claiming that you know better.</p>
<p>Have a nice day, sorry if that came across as vitriolic just think of me as your friendly neighbourhood mercenary homo. <img src="../../images/smileys/grin.gif" alt="" /></p>

<ul id="CommentItem2970History" class="comment_edit"><li>Sat, 10th May 2008 7:40am - Edited by the author</li></ul><p>I really don&#039;t think that this blog explores this issue as far as it could do. An observation that &#039;One of the things I consider to be beautiful about language is its constant change. New words come into being, old ones fall out of use. And of course, existing words mutate and change meaning&#039;, does not seem to clear anything up. I feel that the real question should be: &#039;why has the word &#039;gay&#039;, a word closely aligned with homosexuality, out of all the other existing words become affiliated with derogatory synonyms?&#039; I believe that, without a doubt, the answer is because of underlying societal homophobia. Therefore, in my eyes, anyone who uses &#039;gay&#039; derisively is upholding this homophobic ideology, whether they acknowledge themselves as a homophobe or not.</p>
<p>Of course it&#039;s a fair point to observe that this usage has already sneaked insidiously into our vernacular.   But whether I&#039;m accustomed to it or not does not change the fact that when my younger sibling uses it  thoughtlessly in front of me, her lesbian sister, it feels like a kick in the stomach. Consequently, I try to lead by example, not using this word, as I don&#039;t really understand the stubbornness of those people who vigorously defend their right to use this word - claiming that they&#039;re not homophobic -- why not just pick another adjective?? Just as the word &#039;queer&#039; has etymologically developed from definitions of &#039;perculiar&#039; to derogatory slang for homosexuals and now has been seized as an empowering term for a whole range of studies (i.e Queer theory), perhaps the derisive &#039;gay&#039; will do something similar.</p>

<p>I&#039;m not going to try and re-iterate points that have already been successfully and eloquently put by others on this comment board, but basically I think <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span> ought to rethink what it lets get published if it&#039;s going to cause this much discontent (and rightly so, I&#039;d say). I&#039;m sure no offense was *meant* by this article but that is no excuse for it being rather insulting to a lot of people. I don&#039;t want to get personal at all and to be fair (unfortunately) you have a point ish, but all in all I think the whole article just boils down to ignorance.<br />
So yeah, to any Yorker people who are listening - stop offending people!</p>

<p>#16, the blogs section of <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> is meant to be a place for comment and personal opinion, much like the comment sections in newspapers. Careful consideration was duly taken before publishing this article. As an opinion piece, it does not necessarily reflect the stance of <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> and is published to provoke debate and comparison of different opinions as you yourself have provided.</p>
<p>I hope its publication and the subsequent comments for and against have helped enlighten readers to the hurt the use of the word can cause and they may perhaps reconsider their own opinions. I also hope you agree that it has, albeit not in a way preferred to some, brought attention to an important issue.</p>
<p>My personal beliefs on freedom of speech are another topic entirely... Perhaps another blog! <img src="../../images/smileys/smile.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>I think as a media outlet, <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> have a right to air the views of the public. Have you ever heard of the fact we live in a society that endorses freedom of speech? This blog doesn&#039;t incite hatred or violence of any kind and as such is a legitimate blog.</p>
<p>It may cause offence but that is the nature of journalism and debate...for things to be properly discussed and for people&#039;s minds to be opened to new perspectives and orientations.</p>
<p>If <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> was to censor all blogs, reviews and features in order to protect the feelings of absolutely everybody, (which is essentially what you&#039;re suggesting 16)then it would stagnate and be a decidedly boring outlet of information.</p>
<p>I, for one, condoned the use of the word &#039;gay&#039; due to the quite obvious reallocation of the word. However, after reading comments I have since reconsidered my opinion. I am still undecided but at least it made me think.</p>
