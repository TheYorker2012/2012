		<div class="SubText">On reflection, the 2010 World Cup proved to be a nightmare for England. It was a tournament that above all showed that in recent years the English national team hasn&rsquo;t moved with the times. Fabio Capello promised us a change of approach, and after a successful Euro 2012 qualifying tournament and buoyed by recent wins against Spain and Sweden, can England say they have moved on? </div>

        <p>To put this to the test, I set myself the challenge of trying to create an England team which would be successful on the international scene without including any players who played in the 2010 World Cup. But could it be done? And more importantly could this team compete next summer at Euro 2012? I&rsquo;m saying that they could...</p>
<p><strong>GK &ndash; Joe Hart</strong>. Although Hart travelled to South Africa, he never made an England appearance in the World Cup and therefore makes it into my side. Now the certified England Number 1, he is without a doubt the best goalkeeper in the country. England have never lost a game where Hart has been in goal for the full 90 minutes, and that should be proof enough of his value.</p>
<p><strong>RB &ndash; Micah Richards</strong>. I don&rsquo;t understand why Richards doesn&rsquo;t seem to be in Fabio Capello&rsquo;s current plans because for me he offers so much at right back. He is a tower of strength in defence but also someone who isn&rsquo;t afraid to get forward and attack, as many Premiership left backs will happily testify!</p>
<p><strong>CB &ndash; Phil Jones</strong>. Since his move from Blackburn to Manchester United, Jones has made a huge impact on both the Premiership and the international stage. Without a doubt the spearhead of Capello&rsquo;s &lsquo;next generation&rsquo;, Jones will be around the England set up for many years and has already been earmarked as a future England captain. He has also recently showed his worth in the centre of midfield, but for me he is most natural at centre half and that&rsquo;s where he plays in my team.</p>
<p><strong>CB &ndash; Phil Jagielka</strong>. Jagielka is a player I really rate, and it is nice to see that he is finally getting recognition on the international scene. Often the glue that holds an otherwise shaky Everton defence together, he brings both technical skill and steel to any defence he plays in.</p>
<p><strong>LB &ndash; Leighton Baines</strong>. Wrongly overlooked for the World Cup squad in my opinion, Baines is a highly competent full back who deserves a proper chance in an England shirt. Probably a little sharper going forward than defending, but still the obvious choice when Ashley Cole is taken out of the equation.</p>
<p><strong>DM &ndash; Scott Parker (C)</strong>. Undoubtedly the biggest influence on the England side since South Africa. Parker has been somewhat of a revelation in the England midfield, protecting the defence and controlling play. He seems to have a never ending engine and displays natural leadership qualities in my opinion. My captain and without a doubt the most important player in this team.</p>
<p><strong>DM &ndash; Jack Rodwell</strong>. Possibly a surprise inclusion but Rodwell has a slightly better technical game than Parker and that&rsquo;s why he is included alongside the Tottenham man. Another upcoming star who I am sure will receive many England caps in the future.</p>
<p><strong>RW- Theo Walcott</strong>. It seems like Walcott has been around the England set up for such a long time now, but for me he has never been given an extended opportunity to show what he can do. Blinding pace that would scare any full back is his biggest asset. Another shock exclusion from the World Cup squad last year, but surely a certainty for Euro 2012.</p>
<p><strong>CAM &ndash; Jack Wilshere</strong>. The second jewel in Capello&rsquo;s &lsquo;new generation&rsquo; crown, Wilshere is starting to come into his own for both Arsenal and England and will go to Euro 2012 next year. A richly gifted technical midfielder who is comfortable on the ball, Wilshere is a player that England have been crying out for and is good enough to simultaneously replace both Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard in my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>LW &ndash; Adam Johnson</strong>. Perhaps another surprise inclusion considering Johnson isn&rsquo;t a regular at Manchester City, but I think that he has the potential to succeed for England. We haven&rsquo;t had a classy natural left winger for many years now, and I believe that with the right training and development, Johnson could be that player.</p>
<p><strong>CF &ndash; Darren Bent</strong>. Picking a centre forward for this side was the hardest task by a long way, but I&rsquo;ve opted for Darren Bent to spearhead the attack. His size and strength prove useful when England play 4-5-1 and his hold up play is excellent when the ball arrives either in the air or on the floor. Bent is also a natural goal scorer, and there aren&rsquo;t too many of those around! That&rsquo;s why he gets the nod for me.</p>

<p>Thought about Welbeck but I think he lacks presence as a lone centre forward. Suppose he would make the bench though, so if we&#039;re going that far then the bench would be...</p>

<p>Danny Welbeck isn&#039;t good enough for the Kettering first 11, let alone England!</p>
<p>The problem I see with the above James, particularly for England, is that I don&#039;t think any of them could be described as world class. In fact, man for man (Theo Walcott aside), I genuinely believe the Scottish team has players of equal ability for each of those positions listed and we&#039;re not exactly world beaters at the moment...</p>

<p>I don&#039;t believe each player has to be world class to make a world class team, as long as the team as a whole works well. Sure, most of the Spanish players are world class but we&#039;ve beaten them <img src="../../images/smileys/smile.gif" alt="" /><br />
And Welbeck is amazing <img src="../../images/smileys/smile.gif" alt="" /> Some great subs there too James!</p>

<p>Alan - I&#039;m not totally sure I agree with you there. I can&#039;t think of many better goalkeepers in the world than Joe Hart, and Phil Jones and Scott Parker are oustanding players! True, they may not have that world class name, but for me they unquestionably have bags of ability and the likes of Jones and Wilshere have world class potential in my eyes.</p>
<p>The parallel I&#039;m going to try and draw is with Germany. At Euro 2008 and last year&#039;s World Cup, bar a couple of names, that German side didn&#039;t have any real world class names, but through exposure the likes of Ozil are now considered to be world class players.</p>
<p>And Aimee - totally agree with you. We&#039;ve spent far too long trying to mould the likes of Lampard and Gerrard into one side! It doesn&#039;t always work!!</p>

<p>I would perhaps argue that Mr. Hart would not even make the bench of the Spanish, Dutch or German squads. As for Phil Jones, I have to agree that he has potential, but he has also looked very shaky, particularly in Europe for Man Utd. He&#039;s nowhere near the world&#039;s top defenders at the moment. And as for Wilshere, he&#039;s a player who has managed 4 international caps and barely has two seasons under his belt. Once again, he&#039;s a prospect, in the same way Hargreaves, Owen and Vassell were prospects in their day. We&#039;ll need to see a lot more of him to get even close to calling him world class.</p>

<p>Exactly, Alan - most of these players could be world class eventually but they are just so young at the moment. Capello is building a squad based on potential, which these players all have in abundance, so while this England team is no where near the finished product, it&#039;s an exciting and talented start.</p>

<p>Put it this way - I&#039;d rather see the likes of Jones, Wilshere, Rodwell, Johnson etc given a go than have a midfield of Barry, Lampard, Gerrard and Lennon. Tried and tested hasn&#039;t worked for England in the last seven or eight years and it&#039;s time for something different. England only beat Slovenia at the last World Cup, and I&#039;m pretty sure that my side would beat the USA and Algeria, which is more than the previous lot managed!!</p>
