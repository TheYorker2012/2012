        <p><strong>22:19</strong> <strong>EXEUNT</strong></p>
<p><strong>22:17</strong> Channel 4 think that it went C/La/Li/Oth 13/43/43/1 which seems very odd.</p>
<p>Times thinks C/La/Li 53/13/34</p>
<p>I think that sums it up but for good measure STV 16/34/39, Angus Reid 36/22/32, GA 25/32/37.</p>
<p>As for the ITV and Sun &quot;instant&quot; polls, &quot;instant&quot; isn&#039;t the word I&#039;d use. Out of the ones above; Lib Dem seem to have done very well with Labour and Conservatives not far behind. All of the polls are utter bollocks, however.</p>
<p>It was the worst of the three debates - what did you lot think? Thanks for being with me and I hope you enjoy the final week of election coverage!</p>
<p><strong>22:03</strong> <strong>So what&#039;s the result? Who won?</strong></p>
<p>I think that Gordon Brown was actually in with a chance of being named the winner there, for the first time. Clegg and Cameron did well on other issues - it depends on what issues you care about, I suspect.</p>
<p><strong>22:01</strong> THE END IS NIGH</p>
<p><strong>Cameron: We need to back families. We need to back people and do the right thing. Keeping us safe and secure is important. &quot;I believe the test of a society is how we look after the poor, weak and needy&quot; (orly?) especially in bad times. Conservatives will provide a new government bringing the change that we &#039;need&#039;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Clegg: If we do things differently, there is improvement. We *can* change Britain for good. Think about the promises of the past and the lack of change. Stick with your instincts. &quot;I will work tirelessly to provide fairness for you&quot;. Decent open politics that you can trust. This time, YOU can make the difference.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brown: These debates have been good. They have shown big similarities and big differences. The Conservatives would put the recovery immediately at risk. He has also put the country at risk in schools, policing, health, the less-well-off.. They are not ready for government because they haven&#039;t thought through their politics.</strong></p>
<p><strong>21:56</strong> Lancaster&#039;s internet went down so missed a bit. Sorry.</p>
<p>I&#039;ll take the opportunity to point out that the current Roses score is LANCS 12:4 YORK</p>
<p>More schools debate - is this economy? It&#039;s certainly as dull as the economy - have to say it&#039;s run better and generally much better on BBC than others. But this is just boring.</p>
<p>To back up my point; Charlotte Hogarth-Jones says, &quot;back to the last 10 minutes of this boring debate&quot; and Scott Bryan says, &quot;IT JUST AIN&rsquo;T FRICKIN&rsquo; INTERESTING.&quot; Fairly representative of style but all are agreed... This is fairly dull.</p>
<p>What that probably means is that my estimate for polls tomorrow looks like this: C 36% La 30% Li 29% - and it would be a hung parliament with Conservative lead. Anything could change, however, and people haven&#039;t been thinking as much about local candidates yet. It&#039;s all to play for.</p>
<p><strong>21:51</strong> I like the questions coming from the chair instead of the audience. It allows picking up on issues and forces better replies. There is apparently a 10 year life expectancy difference between poor and rich suburbs and that needs addressing.</p>
<p>Gordon Brown: Teachers are important. Thanks for that.</p>
<p><strong>21:48</strong> Ed Miliband says, &quot;Clegg all over the place on his VAT policy&quot;.</p>
<p>William Hague; &quot;How can Brown say he wants more home ownership when it is falling for the first time since records began?&quot;</p>
<p>There. All parties are useless and we&#039;re &#039;<strong>all doomed</strong>&#039;.</p>
<p>David Cameron compliments teachers. Awwwwww.</p>
<p><strong>21:44</strong> &quot;Cameron curiously flat. This was meant to be his format. Looks like he is regretting he agreed to these debates. Another bronze medal,&quot; Alistair Campbell says. Do you agree?</p>
<p><strong>21:42</strong> Seen the following</p>
<p>INSTANT POLL: Clegg is on 47%, Brown on 36%, Cameron on 17% Vote now: http://bit.ly/agV1io</p>
<p>Seems a bit harsh on Cameron compared to previous debates. He&#039;s not that much worse with the economy than with immigration, surely? But he does again seem to not be winning. Who do you think will come out top in the polls tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>21:41</strong> TWITTER UPDATE</p>
<p><em>I&#039;m moved to tears by the plight of starving chartered accountants. Where can I donate?</em></p>
<p><em>Dear Gordon Brown, please remember that you are no longer responsible for interest rates. Thanks.</em></p>
<p><em>When born millionaires like David Cameron talk about working hard and saving, I do sick in my hand</em></p>
<p><em>There aren&#039;t many brummy accents in the audience?</em></p>
<p><em>Brown looks like he needs a poo</em></p>
<p><strong>21:38</strong> That woman who asked about houses was really pretentious. &quot;I&#039;m rich! Ahahahah. Btw houses&quot; - the answers don&#039;t seem to differ too much between the parties despite the fact that they&#039;re getting in each others&#039; faces.</p>
<p>More debating ensues.</p>
<p><strong>21:29</strong> &quot;Let&#039;s be honest about immigration: you can&#039;t cap European movement. It&#039;s wrong to raise false hopes,&quot; Nick Clegg.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#039;s obvious that the Lib Dems propose an amnesty for illegal immigrants,&quot; David Cameron.</p>
<p>&quot;I agree with David,&quot; Gordon says. &quot;It encourages others to come illegally. But the Conservatives refuse to give a number for the cap so they&#039;re not doing it properly.&quot;</p>
<p>Clegg: &quot;I didn&#039;t create this problem. The other parties caused the havoc in the immigration system. Those that have integrated and want to live here should be allowed to stay. It might be controversial but it solves a problem you created. Get real.&quot;</p>
<p>More bickering ensues.</p>
<p>On a side note, Cameron and Brown look weird with their jackets and is anyone else scared when they look in Cameron&#039;s eyes? Might just be me. He reminds me of the Weeping Angels though...</p>
<p><strong>21:23</strong> William Hague comments on Brown&#039;s statistics: &quot;Brown says 3000 will benefit from inheritance tax cut but the real figure is 4 million.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#039;d quote the others but there isn&#039;t anything of value in there.</p>
<p>Discussion moved on to mention immigrants and &#039;normal people&#039; in very obvious reference to yesterday&#039;s events...</p>
<p><strong>21:13</strong> I like this chair so much more than the previous chairs and this set is better than the previous sets. Kudos to the BBC on actually managing to pull it together and make a good event. Give it another general election or two and it&#039;ll be bigger and better.</p>
<p>I&#039;ll take this opportunity to point out that The Daily Show with Jon Stewart (on 4OD) had a fantastic general election satire section last Thursday. I think you have about 2 hours to watch it, if you want to...</p>
<p><strong>21:11</strong> I have to agree with the many commentators that Nick Clegg&#039;s Euro withdrawal was more out of fear of losing votes than actual belief. Though Cameron&#039;s movements about several issues are fairly dodgy and Brown only seems to be saying that spending is a good thing and they made no mistakes. They&#039;re different to one another but not on a macroscopic level.</p>
<p><strong>21:05</strong> That said, the Greece problem has really caused problems for people supporting Euro. Clegg laughs in Cameron&#039;s face, it seems, when attacked about the Euro. I still think that the Euro issue will favour Cameron, if there is any actual question on it.</p>
<p><strong>21:04</strong> I think Clegg is doing well again - he&#039;s not being attacked by the others - but at the same time I think that it seems to be Brown v Cameron with him sitting on the sideline again. Interesting tactic.... deliberate? Not sure. If Clegg continues to be ignored, there&#039;s a chance that he might drop in the polls. I suspect that it&#039;ll stay about level, however, as things stand.</p>
<p><strong>21:02</strong> Clegg says that there should be NO bonuses for bankers where banks fail to make money.</p>
<p>Brown points out that they bought Northern Rock, RBS, Halifax et al - he says he has &quot;never been so angry&quot; as with bankers. Apparently the global crisis needs a global resolution. Seems fairly obvious but I think Brown is the first to say anything about it?</p>
<p>Cameron: Bankers are bad.</p>
<p>I think they&#039;re basically agreeing whilst still trying to look like they&#039;re better than the others..?</p>
<p><strong>20:58</strong> <strong>***BREAKING NEWS***</strong></p>
<p>Bankers earn too much!</p>
<p><strong>20:57</strong> I think I can summarise the rest of the debate and then go home: Brown wants to spend more. Cameron wants to cut now. Clegg wants to cut some military stuff that doesn&#039;t affect individual troops.</p>
<p>On a different note, Cameron mentions that it&#039;s Brown who is responsible for the economy. Clegg responds with an attack on the needless arguing and tries to answer the actual question.</p>
<p><strong>20:54</strong> Brown attacking Cameron for supporting millionaires, various other economic discussions, Cameron accuses Brown of getting facts wrong. Bickering ensues.</p>
<p><strong>20:48</strong> Not much new in the debate. I&#039;m trying to think of something witty or intelligent to say but am struggling...</p>
<p><strong>20:46</strong> I&#039;m discussing Roses with Lancaster people! Yay! Don&#039;t forget to follow the live blogs and URY/YSTV coverage over the weekend. And don&#039;t forget that tomorrow lunchtime sees the announcement of summer ball acts. And once they&#039;re announced, priority tickets sell pretty quickly! End of shameless plug.</p>
<p><strong>20:43</strong> Nick again looks calm and smart. Not a shiny yellow tie this time. He thinks that everyone should work together, regardless of the election result.</p>
<p>Brown looks as well as Brown can. I don&#039;t like his tie but he is talking well. He&#039;s really attacking Cameron on each question on Cameron&#039;s cuts for the public spending.</p>
<p>Cameron tries to explain the 6 billion cuts. The question is whether the public thinks it is better or worse than more spending.</p>
<p><strong>20:38</strong> Clegg: Efficiency savings won&#039;t cut the black hole. Eurofighter Typhoon cuts and Trident cuts are the answer.</p>
<p>Brown: Growth is essential to recovery. We will rise top-end taxes - and also spending cuts in key periods. We&#039;re not going to let policing, hospitals or schools to be cut. We <em>need</em> to support the economy this year instead of risking a double-dip recession.</p>
<p>Cameron: Cuts would have to be made and there are difficulties. We said that public sector pay will have to be frozen in 2011. We said that people will have to retire a year later. We need to get the economy moving by starting our efficiency savings now.</p>
<p><strong>20:35</strong> <strong>Cameron: There need to be change. We need to reform banks and make things in the UK. We need &quot;value for money&quot; in public services. If you vote for the Tories on Thursday, you&#039;ll still have work on Friday.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Clegg: We need a fairer economy. They caused the mess so we need to be frank about the cuts that are necessary to protect schools and hospitals. We need to rediscover entrepreneurship - and we need fair taxes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brown: I helped the economy in good times and bad. I stopped banks from turning a depression into a recession and we&#039;re recovering. I want to set out the plan of why this year is important. If you grow the economy now, you ensure that employment increases. If you shrink, you damage it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>20:32</strong> Intro isn&#039;t that exciting - let&#039;s hope that it hots up. Side question: no Scotland, Wales or NI Prime Minister debates?</p>
<p><strong>20:26</strong> I&#039;ve been asked to question you all on the following question. <em>Which would be better - a parliament hung like a donkey or a parliament hung like Saddam Hussein?</em> I hope that one of the leaders makes a terrible hung parliament pun.</p>
<p><strong>20:21</strong> So what do you lot think have been the most important moments in the election for deciding how you&#039;ll vote? I interviewed York&#039;s current MP this morning for ((URY)) and there has been more coverage of the local candidates too. <strong>Which one is more important - local or national parties?</strong></p>
<p><strong>20:18</strong> &quot;Gordon knows he has made a big mistake. But he also knows it has upped the stakes for tonight&#039;s debate. It has also probably done wonders for the ratings,&quot; Alistair Campbell says. More MP comments coming later.</p>
<p>On a different note, Charlotte Hogarth-Jones, Ali Matheson and Scott Bryan are repeating their respective live blogs. It&#039;s a good job that you can only see the words we&#039;re writing because those lot are <em>hot</em> and I want to have at least one person reading this!</p>
<p><strong>20:12</strong> A quick glance at twitter:</p>
<p><em>George Osbourne embraced a Swedish model?</em></p>
<p><em>Douglas Alexander is out of sync at on Sky News. No change there</em></p>
<p>And my favourite: <em>SkyNews and YouGov have just announced that David Cameron has won tonight&#039;s debate!</em></p>
<p><strong>20:00</strong> I&#039;m now sitting in an office in Lancaster, preparing for the debate and waiting to see what the various parties say in the run-up to the debate itself. Any comments about yesterday? Not from me. Today&#039;s all about the economy.</p>
<p>For those who are wondering what&#039;s been going on with the economy, <strong>we&#039;re all doomed</strong>. Coincidentally, that&#039;s a summary of last week&#039;s live blog as well.</p>

<p>Local elections are more important and Labour&#039;s Hugh Bayley has done a fantastic job. The party leaders are too similar to be interesting so people should vote based on their MP candidate.</p>

<p>Your coverage was brilliant, per usual, but that debate dragged on. I actually opted to do revision instead :/</p>
<p>And the polls are absurd.</p>
