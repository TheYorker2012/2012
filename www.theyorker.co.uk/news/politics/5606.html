        <p><strong>05:58</strong> With that therefore it&#039;s time for our live coverage here to end. Hopefully this has been sufficiently helpful or informative.</p>
<p>As for me, I&#039;m off for some well deserved sleep!</p>
<p><strong>05:56</strong> As we approach 6AM or 2AM EST, then it appears that as predicted the Republicans&#039; have gained control of the house, but narrowly missed out on the Senate.</p>
<p>There remain some results to come in - with Alaska&#039;s poll still yet to close. But even now, the story has very much been told.</p>
<p>The evening has therefore gone very much the way many predicted.</p>
<p><strong>05:48</strong> BBC figures as well now projecting that the Republicans&#039; have gained control of the lower house with an estimated 230 seats. This represents a swing of around 50 in the Republicans&#039; favour.</p>
<p><strong>05:43</strong> However, in what is less pleasing news for the Democrats, figures suggest that the Republicans&#039; have gained Obama&#039;s old senate seat in Illinois.</p>
<p>A hugely symbolic win and one of 6 Republican gains in the senate. However the Democrats have secured 51 seats, with 3 results still to be announced. The Democrats will therefore retain control of the upper house, however marginally.</p>
<p><strong>05:38</strong> A few updates since we were away.</p>
<p>Harry Reid has survived the threat of Tea Party favourite - Sharron Angle. A crucial hold for the Democrats.</p>
<p><strong>03:38</strong> According to ABC polls, the Republicans&#039; have reached 219 seats - which gives them control of the lower house.</p>
<p>Of course this is still an estimated figure - the BBC&#039;s figures suggest 190 wins for the Republicans thus far (still a higher figure than their previous previous house total).</p>
<p><strong>03:35</strong> Following on from that idea - it seems noteworthy that amongst all the libertarian rhetoric and talk of fiscal responsibility - less has not been said about money spent on campaigning itself.</p>
<p><strong>03:33</strong> There has been much talk about the sums of money that have been spent on this campaign. Indeed, between them Linda McMahon and Meg Whitman have spent more than was spent on the entire UK general election. Notably, McMahon lost and Whitman looks set to lose her Gubernatorial race to Jerry Brown.</p>
<p><strong>03:20</strong> According to ABC figures, the Republicans are only 3 seats away from a majority in the lower house. It is noteworthy that these are estimations - with the BBC&#039;s figure placing the Republicans&#039; at 178 house so far.</p>
<p><strong>03:14</strong> Another important Republican gain in the Senate. Ron Johnson has captured the Senate seat in Wisconsin - their fourth gain thus far.</p>
<p>However only 8 results are yet to be announced. In order to gain control of the upper house, the Republicans would need to gain 6 seats. That means winning 7 out of the 8 remaining races.</p>
<p><strong>02:35</strong> There is much debate amongst the panelists on the BBC&#039;s coverage about potential difficulties in terms of passing any legislation in the wake of these midterm elections.</p>
<p>Not only will a potential Republican lower house make it increasingly difficult for Obama to pass law. Conversely, a Democrat upper house and Obama&#039;s Presidential veto will mitigate the ability of Republicans in congress to pass their own bills.</p>
<p>It&#039;s situations like this that lead one to question the efficacy of the American system and the separation of powers.</p>
<p><strong>02:21</strong> The results of a couple of notable and generally intriguing senate races are yet to be announced.</p>
<p>In Illinois, there is speculation that Obama&#039;s own former senate seat may well turn Red. Additionally, many will be closely watching the result of the Nevada race as Tea Party favourite Sharon Angle looks to gain the seat for the Republicans.</p>
<p><strong>02:06</strong> According to the ABC website - the Republicans&#039; have a lead of 168 to 121 - with 218 needed for a majority.</p>
<p>However it is worth noting that despite the Republican lead, only 11 of the GOP&#039;s 168 victories were gains. The GOP need a total of 39 gains in order to secure the majority and with it control of Congress.</p>
<p><strong>02:03</strong> Polls have now closed in the majority of states. As results begin to trickle in, an ever clearer picture will be painted of America&#039;s new electoral map. There is no doubt that the map will contain far more red - but by how much remains to be seen.</p>
<p><strong>01:45</strong> Thus far there has been a swing of 3 seats towards the Republicans in Senate races - with Republican gains in Indiana, Arkansas and North Dakota.</p>
<p>The Republicans need a swing of 10 however and there is growing speculation that this will not happen. Democrat victories in Delaware, West Virgina and Connecticut have made the Republicans&#039; seizing control of the upper house less and less likely.</p>
<p><strong>01:36</strong> You only have to listen to the speech of new Republican senator Marco Rubio in order to hear the difference between American and British politics. The Tea Party backed candidate and new Florida senator opens his speech with the line - &quot;we are all children of a great and powerful God&quot;.</p>
<p>It&#039;s difficult to imagine the response if a British politician started any speech like that.</p>
<p><strong>01:28</strong> Apologies for the delay - my internet situation has been a wee bit problematic.</p>
<p>Having returned, this seems to be an ideal moment to suggest <a href="5619.html">this article</a> by Miles Deverson. Well worth a read, it takes a rather acerbic look at the Tea Party and the response of Stewart and Colbert.</p>
<p><strong>01:04</strong> Similarly, the Republicans&#039; have been making gains in the lower house with 6 thus far. A further 33 are needed if the GOP is to gain control of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p><strong>01:01</strong> A vast majority of the senate seats results announced thus far have gone the Republicans&#039; way. However the crucial figure is that the GOP has made 2 net gains from the Democrats. A further 8 gains are needed in order for the Republicans&#039; to gain control of the house - 21 results are yet to be announced.</p>
<p><strong>00:56</strong> It has been very odd seeing Linda McMahon run in this race. McMahon is the former CEO of the WWE - and as someone who (for my sins) has grown up with wrestling - it is hugely bizarre seeing a woman who once kicked her husband in the crotch running for the American upper house. Then again - that&#039;s American politics...</p>
<p><strong>00:50</strong> Another rare glimmer for joy for the Democrats as Richard Blumenthal held off the challenge of Linda McMahon for the Conneticut senate seat. McMahon a moderate Republican, was no Tea PArty favourite but was very, very well funded. The Democrats can breath a sigh of relief.</p>
<p><strong>00:35</strong> In an important developmnt - John Boozman has won the Arkansas senate seat for The Republicans - this is significant as it represents a Republican gain.</p>
<p><strong>00:15</strong> Finally there is good news for the Democrats as Christopher Coons defeats Christine O&#039;Donnell in Delaware. Chrstine O&#039;Donnell was of course a notable example of a surprise Republican candidate, swept in by Republican support.</p>
<p><strong>23:54</strong> It has nbt been a great start for The Democrats, that at least is certain. Their sole triumph thus far has been Patrick Leahy retaining his seat in Vermont. But then, that is Vermont - the same state that elected Bernie Sanders - a man who calls himself a Democratic Socialist. If Vermont were electing Republicans then it really would be a sign that the end is nigh for Democrats.</p>
<p><strong>23:39</strong> The Republicans continue to have success in senatorial battles as Rob Portman wins in Ohio and Jim DeMint holds in South Carolina.</p>
<p><strong>23:22</strong> The senate race&#039;s in Kentucky and Indiana have both beenn won by Republicans. Kentucky was won by the staunchly conservative Rand Paul, with Dan Coats winning the race in Indiana. It&#039;s been all red so far - the victories meaning that the Republicans have thus far won 2 out of the 37 contested senate seats.</p>
<p><strong>23:00</strong> Perhaps the biggest talking point at the moment is the ABC exit poll which is being widely discussed by the media. It provides a generally grim picture for the incumbents - suggesting overall dissatisfaction with the government. The link can be found <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/politics/2010_elections/National?ep=house">her</a>) and ABC&#039;s anlysis <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/vote-2010-elections-results-midterm-exit-poll-analysis/story?id=1200377">here</a></p>
<p><strong>22:38</strong> If Indiana&#039;s first result of the evening is anything to go by - the Democrat&#039;s really are in trouble. Mike Pence has held the sixth district of Indiana with a staggering 75% of the vote. Although &quot;held&quot; may be the operative word, the Republicans need 39 gains in order to take over the House of Representatives.</p>
<p><strong>22:28</strong> Tonight&#039;s very first victor is Republican Hal Rogers who has held Kentucky&#039;s first district. The first of many Republican victories? We shall see!</p>
<p><strong>22:07</strong> The first polls in Indiana and Kentucky have closed - stay tuned for updates on exit polls as they become known.</p>
<p><strong>21:06</strong> We are only an hour away from the first polls closing in Kentucky and Indiana. More regular updates will begin in the next hour or two.</p>
<p><strong>19:03</strong> <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> will start liveblogging the US midterm elections tonight! Stay tuned!</p>
