        <p><strong>Expecting a bizarre ego-parade, I was pleasantly surprised at the eclectic explosion of clothes, costume, dancing and modelling in this year&rsquo;s Fusion. The theme, &lsquo;twisted&rsquo; fairytales, came across creatively yet clearly through both the dancers and the models. From ballet to hip-hop, interpretative, tap and waltz, the dancers relentlessly powered Central Hall with a contagious energy. Accompanied by powerful bass rhythms (ranging from Aphex Twin to The Specials) and twinkling lights, the overall effect of the show was superb and will undoubtedly raise significant funds for the RAG charities.
</strong></p>
<p>The two fused elements, modelling and dance, both merged together fluidly; yet there was a considerable discrepancy in the energy levels. Though backstage was alive with adrenalin and excitement, some models unfortunately failed to carry this onto the stage; resulting in bored faces and lowered eye-lines, which regrettably do not do the performers&rsquo; emotions justice. The clothes were diverse and beautiful; however, though modelling is essentially about the clothes, within such a show it is equally about the posture, focus and energy of the models. Attractive people still need to perform. Directly contrasted with the dancers, there could be no match. The dancers filled Central Hall to the back row with their enormous presence, regardless of there being either two or thirty-two performers onstage.</p>
<p>Saying this, considering the amount of people onstage at one time, all performers used the space carefully and successfully. The modelling sequences were choreographed and synchronised well. Their relationship with the dancers was consistent; where the models were immaculate and upright, the dancers were sprawling, sharp and captivating. This was an ocular delight to be highly commended, the enormity of the cast and the manner in which the stage was filled was consistently impressive. From an aesthetic perspective, the hair and make-up was quirky, all adding to the twisted theme. Constant scene and lighting changes in addition to the perpetual movement held the audience transfixed from the &lsquo;Snow White&rsquo; inception to the visual feast of a finale. Particular highlights of the show were: the smooth uncloaking in &lsquo;Little Red Ridings&rsquo; In The Hood&rsquo;, the animalistic Pied Piper&rsquo;s Rat Dance, the enchanting &lsquo;Cinderella&rsquo; waltz, the spasmodically macabre chessboard-esque &lsquo;Modern Ball&rsquo;, the human pumpkin carriage and the whole of the &lsquo;Peter Pan&rsquo; sequence.</p>
<p>Jeremy Lilley and Danielle Spears deserve a pat on the back to say the least. Fusion is a gigantic project to take on as a choreographer, and to do so successfully is a remarkable feat. Though choreography throughout the production was brilliant, personally my three favourite numbers were the mesmeric dwarf battle (choreographed by Sarah Jordan and Chi-San Howard), dynamic lost boys&rsquo; dance (choreographed by Sarah Howell), and the flawlessly synchronised shadow dance (Bhavik Pankhania, Lucy Allen, Saki Kunimoto, Chi-San Howard and Sarah Howell).</p>
<p>Fusion requires huge commitment on behalf of the production team as well as the performers, and I can certify that their time has definitely been worth it. To casually dismiss this campus event as an egocentric &lsquo;clique&rsquo; (as I have heard it referenced) is frankly insulting. This is a production of large-scale diversity and teamwork- over 150 students are involved- and a very successful one at that. Ultimately, no amount of creative adjectives can do this piece of great live entertainment justice. Go and see it for yourself, remember all profits go to charity; I guarantee you will not be disappointed.</p>

			<p>This years Fusion was in one word TERRIBLE. The so called twisted fairy tale theme was pointless as they didn&#039;t manage to pass this across to a fairytale maniac like me. Cinderella had no glass slippers instead the models wore horrible wigs. Cesca&#039;s introduction was appalling she sounded and looked uneasy . And just because you are the fusion president does not give you the right to dance on the show. You are a bad dancer so should have just stock with focussing on giving a better speech. The beginning of the show had prospects but the second half was disastrous. The dances were monotonous and long, that I had to keep on checking my wrist whatch. What do fairy tales have to do with girls in their underwear and boys walking around topless through out the show. The scene where the three girls were singing with a boy and girl lying on the floor was very confusing and overstretched. Some of the modelling parts were a bit random. Some dance scenes were overcrowded, rowdy and monotonous. I loved a few scenes like the scene where the topless guy was dancing with the girls in the black suits. The ACS dance was energetic, the belly dancers were great. The ending in my opinion was drastic, after all the rowdiness it was a cute scene asking do you still believe in fairy tales. Well I still do believe in them even if you tried to ruin it for me. As a student acquiring debt I think this was a waste of &pound;6. I watched the last years show and it was by far better with the infusion of many societies and a much better theme.Should I say the organisers did a bad job, no ill just say they could have done much better..</p>

<p>In response to the first comment, you seem to be making unneccessarily harsh comments about a production and a president who worked extremely hard to produce something that in my opinion was a great success. In no way was Cesca unable to dance, she auditioned and got in to Fusion exactly as every other dancer did and why her speech was even mentioned is bizarre! Too harsh.</p>

<p>#4  how can you say that it is a shame that they could not repeat last years performance based on the view of one anonymous comment. Having attended fusion last year and this year I would have to say that this years performance was as good is not better.</p>
<p>#1 you seem to forget that the theme was twisted fairytales and so the usual aspects of fairytales, such as cinderella having glass clippers,were not intended.</p>
<p>Overall I have to say well done to everyone involved as they put on an incredible performance.</p>

<p>&#039;the ACS dance was energetic&#039; energetic yes, but good definatly not! In my opinion it was the most disappointing part of the show. Last years ACS was amazing and i was looking forward to a repeat this year and was horribly disappointed.</p>
<p>I thought this years fusion performance was brilliant and know plenty of people that agree. It was exciting and a bit different and if you read the programme then it explained the show very well! The dancing was brilliant and actually i enjoyed seeing the president in it!</p>
<p>Well done to everyone involved on producing a wonderful show and most importantly raising alot of money for the RAG charities.</p>

<p>#1 I don&#039;t know what show you were watching, but it definitely wasn&#039;t Fusion. &quot;The dances were monotonous and long&quot; : no, they were diverse and fresh - with pointe, tap, contemporary, street, interpretive, ballroom and jazz styles how could dances bore you?<br />
Also, Cesca went through the audition process along with the other Fusion dancers - she may not be the most talented performer in the show, but she deserved to be on stage - did you see her make a mistake? NO.<br />
Perhaps rather than insulting Fusion anonymously, you should run for committee and actually do something about it.</p>

<ul id="CommentItem8799History" class="comment_edit"><li>Mon, 8th Mar 2010 9:07pm - Edited by the author</li></ul><p>#1 Some of the most talented dancers made many mistakes on stage, and as far as I know Cesca was not one of them. If she appeared nervous in her speech (which wasn&#039;t apparent to me), maybe it was because she was aware people like you were in the audience waiting to pounce on anything she does. The nice thing about Fusion is that, contrary to common stereotypes, it is not exclusively for &#039;beautiful people&#039; and it is open to a wide range of talent and abilities, this includes dancers and Cesca was by no means the worst, for you to pinpoint her alone completely undermines everything you say as it clearly seems you have some personal vendetta against her. With regards the dances being long and monotonous, particularly in the second half: did you see modern ball? There was definitely nothing monotonous about that.</p>
<p>It is a shame you feel the need to waste your time slagging off the hardwork and dedication of fellow students over &pound;6, maybe you should spend more time on your degree so you can get a good job to pay off that epic debt you&#039;ve just racked up...</p>
<p>#4 Please don&#039;t be informed by #1&#039;s comments, I have only heard good things about it and, even if it didn&#039;t satisfy everyone, it is clearly subjective.</p>
<p>Congratulations to everyone who was involved and thank you to everyone who has given their support. I have no doubt the charities and causes Fusion has helped are grateful, no matter what you perceived the overall to be.</p>

<p>Fusion is all about raising money for charity and having a good time. I would be very interested to see if #1 has ever danced a day in his/her life? I have been dancing for many many years and this is some of the best choreography I have ever had the pleasure of performing. The dances were challenging but incredibly worthwhile. Your attitude towards Fusion suggests that you are uninformed about the energy, dedication and time that has gone into this whole production. Having been in the past three Fusion&#039;s I feel that all the shows have been special. As for your personal attack on Cesca she has dedicated her time and talent to Fusion and more importantly to RAG charities. As dancers we are allowed to make mistakes, but we enjoy every single second of being on stage and that is what really matters.</p>

<p>To be honest, just because a lot of time and effort goes into something it doesn&#039;t automatically make it any good. People come to see Fusion because it is a PERFORMANCE, regardless of whether or not you are raising money for charity. As for the attention given to Cesca - if you are the President and make a speech during the show, of course attention will be given to her as a face now standing out from the rest. Therefore it is somewhat expected that she should stand out as a dancer, seeing as she is leading the rest.</p>
<p>Also, you can talk about the charity work which, of course, is honourable and a good thing to do, but don&#039;t ram it down people&#039;s throats who are bold enough to state the plain truth that this year&#039;s show wasn&#039;t as good as previous years.</p>

<p>I think that #1 should take into account the tremendous amount of effort, organisation and commitment it takes to put on a show like fusion. The cast, backstage crew, committee and production team worked incredibly hard to make it the best it could be. Not only did every member of fusion sacrifice personal time for rehearsals and practices, they put every effort into creating a high-energy atmosphere which was reflected in both performances. Have you ever been a part of something as time consuming and physically draining as fusion and then had your every action critised? I hope not, as it&#039;s not a very nice thing to experience.</p>

<p>#1 I hope none of your friends were in Fusion because this is no way to support them. But then if they weren&#039;t I can&#039;t imagine why you would have gone to watch when you&#039;re so clearly on a mission to slag it off. Unless, of course, you auditioned and were rejected which would completely explain why you feel the need to devalue the work of others. If none of the above is true, it&#039;s a shame you have nothing better to do with your life, get a hobby...<br />
I personally very much enjoyed Fusion, the hard work and dedication of the cast and crew paid off and made it fantastic and memorable show for all the right reasons. As for Cesca, hair, make-up and costume mean I couldn&#039;t point her out to you now and definitely had no hope when she was on stage, far away and changing her appearance in each scene - I had trouble picking out my housemates. She is president, not queen dancer, there&#039;s no need for her to stand out as an amazing dancer, she&#039;s there to organise and delegate to create an enjoyable and exciting show and, to 99% of the audience, she passed with flying colours. Sorry if it didn&#039;t match your standards - maybe RAG will give you your &pound;6 back so you can stop putting other people down just because you feel bad.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Firstly I feel that someone needs to own up and actually say who they are on this forum when they are making a comment. Thanks for all of you who&#039;ve stuck up for the show here. Being on the committee I am biased towards Fusion. But I personally saw just how much hard work was put into the show, especially from Jeremy and Danielle. I think #1 should have a think about how stupid and petty their comments are.</p>
<p>I agree with all of the replies from others above and don&rsquo;t want to say them again. However, if #1 thought Fusion was that bad perhaps they&#039;d like to run for Head Choreographer in the upcoming Fusion elections. Then they might realise how ridiculous it is to belittle the hundreds of hours of hard work and organisation that went into the show.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who watched the show and for all the positive comments that have come back. It shouldn&#039;t be the case that we as a committee are only interested in &#039;nice&#039; feedback about the show. However the very personal and bitchy comments made by #1 take the idea of constructive criticism a bit too far. Keep those thoughts to yourself.</p>

<p>I&#039;d like to take this opportunity to congratulate everyone on a great show this year.</p>
<p>It&#039;s kind of #1 to be so complimentary of last year&#039;s production, however it&#039;s worth noting that Cesca was on last year&#039;s committee too!</p>
<p>People are allowed to their opinions and i think it&#039;s great that we have an outlet to voice our comments on; however #1 is wrong in personally attacking Cesca. Dislike the show if you will, comment on the scenes you thought were weak even, but do not insult individuals who (even if one thinks were uncomfortably nervous, which I didn&#039;t) have invested months of hard work into Fusion &#039;Telling Tales&#039;. #1 your criticism is not constructive and this is why I find it offensive.</p>
<p>I find it confusing that people are so willing to slam projects like Fusion when they merely watched. #11 you are of course quite right. Fusion is a perfomance and people do deserve to be entertained, however you are wrong about Cesca &quot;leading the rest&quot;. The role of President is very different to that of Head Choreographer or Creative Director and, as such, criticism is unfair when given for these reasons. Whether you agree with Cesca&#039;s speech or not, for #1 to call it &#039;appalling&#039; is unhelpful.</p>
<p>Having been so heavily involved last year I was extremely anxious about watching this year&#039;s production. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I thought the execution of the vast majority of scenes was fantastic and the committee and cast should be congratulated.</p>
<p>Whether you love it or hate it Fusion attracts more attention than any other show on campus. On Saturday night there Central Hall was full to the rafters (no easy task!) and the vast majority of people went away thoroughly entertained as indicated by #s9, 13 et al!</p>
<p>Constructive criticism is welcomed and extremely useful in all walks of life. Personal insults aren&#039;t.</p>
<p>Well done to everyone involved.<br />
