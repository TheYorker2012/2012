		<div class="SubText">Ben McCluskey and Harriet Evans live-blog YUSU candidate question time.</div>

        <p><strong>22:36</strong> Thanks to Harriet for helping me write this blog, thanks to the candidates for keeping us entertained (and certain members of the audience) and thanks to you for reading!</p>
<p><strong>22:34</strong> And we&#039;re done! Home time and sleep time!</p>
<p><strong>22:34</strong> Sam speaks... we&#039;re almost done. Believes discussions on the student market need to be open to find out what students want. Chooses services over democracy, as he thinks there needs to be a way to involve people - services do that in his opinion. He picks Nouse over Vision.</p>
<p><strong>22:33</strong> Walker thinks the student market was a brilliant idea, but has issues with the organisation of the concept.  He opts for services, as it directly affects people more than democracy.</p>
<p>And he goes for Nouse, despite enjoying Vision more.</p>
<p>Nouse 2 0 Vision</p>
<p><strong>22:31</strong> Chris starts us off. Thinks the student market is a nice idea in principle; would like to see Costcutter removed. He offends YSTV by suggesting that Nouse are filming him; but chooses Nouse over vision &quot;because of their blog and all the wonderful comments&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>22:30</strong> Big cheers for the final round of questions</p>
<p>Would you bring a student market to campus?
Which is more important Democracy or Services?
Nouse or Vision? (was that a groan accompanying this question??)</p>
<p><strong>22:29</strong> Ooooh... Kat wants to check something before continuing. Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>22:29</strong> Dan believes it is important that YUSU are environmentally friendly. Heavily critical of the Courtyard heaters; gets an applause from the crowd. Dan would vote for Sam as he thinks he has better policies than Chris. Regarding surveys, he&#039;s all for engaging students more.</p>
<p><strong>22:28</strong> Chris up now; thinks recycled bottles and water coolers are an important idea.  He would vote for Sam Daniels because of his fantastic array of knowledge regarding YUSU and services.  He would definately promote the National Survey as much as he could, for example on plasma screens and through newsletters.  Nothing contraversial there.</p>
<p><strong>22:27</strong> Jason Rose is trying to submit another question... don&#039;t do it J...</p>
<p><strong>22:25</strong> Sam steps up to wooping and horn sounds. Jim Bulley has the horn, in case you were wondering. Regarding bottled water, he says it depends on what students want - says The Courtyard and Your Shop should work to accommodate this. He&#039;d vote for Dan if he wasn&#039;t running; stresses the importance of using National Student Survey data.</p>
<p><strong>22:25</strong> Almost done now, but some more questions first...</p>
<p>What do you think about YUSU banning selling bottled water, instead putting water coolers in key areas?
Who would you vote for, if you weren&#039;t running?
Will you commit to helping get student input for the National Student Survey?</p>
<p><strong>22:23</strong> Penultimate round of questions... yes please!</p>
<p><strong>22:23</strong> Daniels would like to point out that every candidate thinks he can do better than the candidate before.  Headline policy/ Entertainment review.  He thinks everyone should have a chance to discuss what they want for events.  He wants a student-led reform of campus events: sounds exciting.</p>
<p>As for those pesky patio heaters, he doesn&#039;t know enough about their usage, but now he knows there is an issue, he would seriously look into it.</p>
<p><strong>22:22</strong> Dan says he&#039;d have consulted students more than Lewis has, and would be more open. Believes Lewis can occasionally throw up walls for JCRCs, when YUSU should knock walls down. His headline policy is college strength; believes sport is important for raising college spirit. Would like to provide funding and work with YUM to give colleges space in campus media.</p>
<p><strong>22:19</strong> Chris says if he&#039;d been in Lewis&#039; shoes, he&#039;s publicise UGMs and Hustings better. Believes the selling point of his campaign is bringing more to campus - bands, for example.</p>
<p><strong>22:19</strong> What would you do differently from the current D&amp;S officer?
What is your headline policy?  How would it work?
Patio heaters at the Courtyard are bad for the environment.  would you find a better alternative?</p>
<p><strong>22:18</strong> I think I may have tempted fate by saying we&#039;d be out of here by 11; lots of questions for the D&amp;S candidate, my back is starting to hurt.</p>
<p><strong>22:18</strong> Sam does the Chandler dance... I think Dan&#039;s Carlton dance was better. He made his decision to run when he realised he was confidence in the ideas he had; doesn&#039;t tell us when that was though.</p>
<p><strong>22:17</strong> Chris has refused to dance... boos from the crowd... they&#039;re having none of it.</p>
<p>He decided to run while organsising the Haiti walk and - sorry, I can&#039;t get over the lack of dance!</p>
<p><strong>22:17</strong> Dan does the Carlton dance! Epic. He says the mobile Courtyard is the unique selling point of his campaign... and says it&#039;s very much a viable policy. He made the final decision to run for a sabbatical position at the start of this term, believing he&#039;d done a good enough job as Goodricke Chair to justify running.</p>
<p><strong>22:14</strong> Yet more questions... aha! this time it&#039;s the questions they themself suggested.  Clever.</p>
<p><strong>22:13</strong> Dan does not agree with catered colleges; believes the MAD scheme is sufficient for catered colleges and does not force students to be catered. Thinks forcing students into catered colleges is a welfare issue; would affect vegetarians and would not let students learn to cook before moving into private accommodation. Would keep the role of President, alongside Welfare and Sport. Believes sport is important for involving everyone. &quot;When people get involved in sport, they get involved in their college&quot;. Kat does not let Dan ask two questions; she tells us she&#039;s mean.</p>
<p><strong>22:11</strong> Chris now.</p>
<p>Supports catered colleges, but thinks students have not been adequately consulted, and so agrees with Daniels that a UGM motion should be held on this matter.
President, treasurer and welfare would be his chosen sabbs and if not standing, Etheridge would ask, &quot;What is your unique selling point?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>22:09</strong> Sam: Thinks it is disgraceful that the idea of catered colleges was never taken to UGM or Union Council. Says we need to open up the debate. Believes compulsory charges for food will cause colleges to miss out. If he had to only have three sabbatical positions, he&#039;d keep President, Academic and Welfare. He&#039;d ask students to do a dance; and demonstrates a dance of his own.</p>
<p><strong>22:08</strong> here you go, the next round of questions:</p>
<p>What do you think about catered colleges?
If you could only have three sabb positions in YUSU, what would they be? and
If you weren&#039;t standing, what question would you ask?</p>
<p><strong>22:06</strong> Some people seem to be more interested in commenting on Nouse&#039;s liveblog than listening to candidates.</p>
<p><strong>22:06</strong> Sam takes the stage. Believes encouraging more female students is important, but stresses that in recent years we have had some good female Sabbs. Suggests also encouraging more female involvement at a lower level. Praises the work of Ben Humphrys for disabled students, and praises the work of Disability Officer Claire Cornock to raise awareness of the problems disabled students face. Wants to involve freshers more from the start of their time at university.</p>
<p><strong>22:05</strong> David Clarke has just submitted a question... Kat&#039;s concentrating hard on this next selection.</p>
<p><strong>22:04</strong> Walker thinks the female candidate question is difficult, he looks lost for words... if people are feeling they are disadvantaged, he thinks a booklet-type thing would be a good idea to ensure fair representation of campaigns.</p>
<p>Pockets of disengaged students?  Science students! He thinks it&#039;s important to have better YUSU and college presence around the science buildings.  Oh, and Halifax and Goodricke, of course.</p>
<p><strong>22:02</strong> Chris says it is a problem that there are few women running for positions, says we need to show them why it&#039;s such a good opportunity. Would offer to meet every disabled student who has problems with the current system in person to address their concerns. Notes that Halifax and New Goodricke feel isolated because of their location, and believes are number of students are currently disengaged with the Union.</p>
<p><strong>22:01</strong> More questions!</p>
<p>2 minutes for the entre thing this time...</p>
<p>Any changes to the system to encourage more women candidates?
How will you ensure disabled students can interact with campus democracy/
Can you name three students pockets you think are disengaged with YUSU?</p>
<p><strong>22:00</strong> Jim Bulley seems to have decided that Chris Etheridge looks like Arthur; thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>21:59</strong> Chris says he would &quot;in no way threaten Big D&quot;; if he doesn&#039;t get elected, he&#039;s applied for an MA in History and Politics. Makes a fun about things &quot;not going swimmingly this year&quot; which gets a groan from the audience; his back stroke is more popular.</p>
<p><strong>21:59</strong> Daniels doesn&#039;t think he&#039;ll be able to match Walker&#039;s swimming.</p>
<p>He wants to protect Big D and echo that enthiusiasm all over campus.
A year&#039;s time?  Having reformed elections and made progress with his policies(if won, of course)
Swimming?  Ah, words can not explain the epicness of these demonstrations.  At least Daniels remembered to breath.</p>
<p><strong>21:58</strong> Ollie Hutchings also likes the breast stroke; he&#039;s just done an impression up the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>21:57</strong> Dan thinks Big D is an important event that goes beyond Derwent College. Does not see a reason to threaten it; says it&#039;s established and it works. Says he would not remain as Democracy and Services Officer for a second year if elected; not sure what he&#039;d do after D&amp;S except maybe a PGCE. He likes the breast stroke; the audience likes his impression of it.</p>
<p><strong>21:55</strong> What&#039;s your opinion of Big D?  Would you safeguard to for the future?
Where do you see yourself in 1 year&#039;s time?
Please demonstrate your fave swimming stroke.</p>
<p>Hmm, could be interesting.</p>
<p><strong>21:54</strong> Dan thinks the stadium idea would need to be looking into fully and if built, kept away from accomodation. Says it would be a positive move and increase links within the community. Has more issue with moving services into staff than moving democracy to the President; says it&#039;s important for a student to be in control of services, having come up through the university. Agrees with Sam that democracy is important for determining availability of ethical products. Says the Democracy and Services has to respect the vote of students.</p>
<p><strong>21:52</strong> Chris supports the stadium idea and thinks sports people at York are desperate for a swimming pool, but only if it were financially viable.  He also thinks democracy and services should be under specific student representatives.  He&#039;s all for ethical.  Good for him.</p>
<p><strong>21:51</strong> Sam thinks a stadium on Hes East would be fantastic if possible. Wants to ensure that students get the best out of York&#039;s sports facilities. Thinks Democracy and Services is an important role, shows you what you can and can&#039;t do and how to represent students; does not think it should become a &quot;staff member&quot; role. Thinks it&#039;s good to talk about fewer options and risking profit; thinks if the union wants to be more ethical, it needs to look into moving away from big name brands. Says the process should be democratic.</p>
<p><strong>21:51</strong> YUSU President, Tim is in the house</p>
<p><strong>21:50</strong> Noodles being eaten in front of me are very distracting.</p>
<p><strong>21:49</strong> Some more questions for our D&amp;S candidates:</p>
<p>City of York Council has discussed idea of a stadium possibly on Hes East, what do you think?
What do you think of the proposal to bring democracy under the remit of the President and services under a paid member of staff?
Risk profit and offer ethical options, or play safe?</p>
<p><strong>21:47</strong> Sam thinks the monorail is a fantastic idea but won&#039;t happen. Spins the question nicely to stress that links around campus are important, such as the number 6 bus between Hes East and Hes West. Thinks a YUSU complaints procedure would work as the university&#039;s system takes over three weeks. Suggests students could go on record and have an independent hearing, but wants to look at other university systems first. Does not believe his campaign is negative; says it doesn&#039;t get you anywhere to be negative.</p>
<p><strong>21:47</strong> He&#039;s trying not to laugh over the monorail idea.  Apparently that idea&#039;s been around since he was a fresher.
Doesn&#039;t think that offensive behaviour is acceptable in any University situation and blocking students from campus events could perhaps be used as a reprimand.
Campaign negative? He thinks that his campiagn could be construed as intending to tell people what was best for them, but this is not what he wants to do.  He wants to allow people to make informed decisions over services.</p>
<p><strong>21:43</strong> Chris says the idea of a campus monorail came up in his campaign meetings; says it&#039;s an amusing idea but does not support it. Believes students should be able to complain about offensive behaviour, but says it is the responsibility of the university to deal with these complaints and reprimand students. Calls his campaign positive for avoiding broken promises.</p>
<p><strong>21:42</strong> What do you think of a campus monorail?
Should the YUSU constitution allow for students who wish to complain about other students with regards to offensive behaviour and offer reprimands?
do you think there are any aspects of your campaign that are negative?</p>
<p><strong>21:41</strong> Chris is up last. Says you should not make financial commitments until you&#039;re aware you can meet them. Lists the Gaza walk as his biggest achievement - 28 miles walked, over &pound;3,000 raised. Regarding McQs, highlights the need to look at the accounts again.</p>
<p><strong>21:40</strong> Daniels up next.</p>
<p>Summer ball?  Better act would get more people involved and make a better event - but would have to be careful in the long run that this would affect Student Activities.  He is most proud of running Access All Areas but thinks we need to concetrate on what we&#039;ve got before we start expanding and thinks diversity is a good thing for campus - so would keep McQs as it is.</p>
<p><strong>21:38</strong> Dan answers the questions first. Thinks YUSU should spend more money on a larger act for Freshers Ball; believes this can be done without increasing the ticket price too much. Says his biggest achievement at uni is leading Goodricke onto Heslington East, says his JCRC performed outstandingly in keeping the Goodricke spirit alive on a remote location. If offered McQs, he&#039;d consult students, look at the accounts carefully, and look into making it a real ale bar. The audience seems to like the idea of real ale.</p>
<p><strong>21:36</strong> Now, some questions...</p>
<p>Again the summer ball question - up prices to get better acts?
What is your best achievement since being at Uni?
What would you do, if you were offered to take over McQs from commercial services?</p>
<p><strong>21:35</strong> Ollie Hutchings has just submitted a question</p>
<p><strong>21:35</strong> Next up, it&#039;s Dan Walker. Dan says he won&#039;t bore us by telling us about his experiences as Goodricke Chair. Says he has the passion and commitment to make his policies happen. Wants YUSU to work more closely with colleges - a college-focused Freshers Week. Also wants more gigs on campus; wants to get the ball rolling on making getting bigger bands to York. Believes YUSU democracy should be more transparent. Criticises Freshers Ball and says he wants to reformat it. Very keen on the idea of a shopping bus; says he&#039;ll drive it himself if he has to.</p>
<p><strong>21:35</strong> Walker&#039;s been asked to stand further away from the microphone.</p>
<p><strong>21:34</strong> Chris up next.</p>
<p>Central Hall; more YUSU comedy; swimming pool; free drinking water in the library... Etheridge is outlining the promises that he has checked out, and is determined he can fulfil.</p>
<p>As YUSU campaigns officer he has learnt change takes time, it&#039;s nice to get a candidate recognising this.</p>
<p>Again, tells us his blog, facebook page etc</p>
<p><strong>21:31</strong> Jason Rose is here by the way. I&#039;m not sure when he arrived.</p>
<p><strong>21:31</strong> It&#039;s no Chinese, but the second bag of Monster Munch is open...</p>
<p><strong>21:30</strong> Sam starts the speaking. He thinks it&#039;s time that officers are held to account more, and lists some of the accomplishments of previous Union officers. He promises to build on this progress. Wants to use the plasma screens around campus more and bring better entertainment to campus. Stresses importance of college spirit and maintaining it. Talks about one of his key policies - the YUSU loyalty card. The audience seems to love him.</p>
<p><strong>21:29</strong> Sam Daniels, Chris Etheridge and Dan Walker standing for Democracy and Services</p>
<p><strong>21:26</strong> Takeaway that is, not the people - just in case anyone was wondering</p>
<p><strong>21:23</strong> Harriet&#039;s getting distracted by the Chinese...</p>
<p><strong>21:22</strong> Frecks comes to speak to me again about Democracy and Services; he thinks it&#039;ll be a close one, but suggests that Chris Etheridge has already had a significant presence on campus.</p>
<p><strong>21:20</strong> Another five minute break before the Democracy and Services candidates get to speak. This just in: Nouse&#039;s Chinese order has arrived! It smells quite good, I&#039;m slightly regretting my decision to opt out...</p>
<p><strong>21:20</strong> Katy thinks it&#039;s difficult to decide, but YUSU Fair 2 has to take it for Rhianna&#039;s achievements.
She&#039;d vote for Nick on account of his far more experience and a better campaign</p>
<p>Apparently has Jack Russel slippers, so the feet thing wouldn&#039;t be so weird... plus, being a vegetarian, she doesn&#039;t think the badger would be too great.</p>
<p><strong>21:19</strong> I&#039;ve just been informed that the member of the audience who was turned down so epically by Kat was in fact the infamous Tom Flynn.</p>
<p><strong>21:18</strong> Here&#039;s Rachel! She says YUSU Fair 2 is Rhianna&#039;s best achievement, a great second chance for students. Said she&#039;d vote for Luke if she wasn&#039;t running, believes they have similar policies. Would prefer Jack Russell feet to eating a live badger.</p>
<p><strong>21:18</strong> Scarlett thinks Rhianna has done a lot of really great things, but &quot;We Are Golden&quot; is the greatest.</p>
<p>He&#039;d back Katy because he thinks she has a fresh approach.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#039;t even try and eat the live badger... too much hassle...
Jack Russels - entertaining for a time
...
And he picks the Jack Russels</p>
<p><strong>21:17</strong> In response to a comment from the audience that badgers are the UK&#039;s largest carnivores, Kat corrects him and states that they&#039;re omnivores. Can we keep her, please?</p>
<p><strong>21:16</strong> Luke praises Rhianna again, and believes she developed the idea of society forums well. Would vote for Rachel if he wasn&#039;t running, says her polices are better than Nick&#039;s or Katy&#039;s. Would eat the live badger, hopefully before it claws his face.</p>
<p><strong>21:15</strong> Last two questions:</p>
<p>What is Rhianna&#039;s best achievement so far? and
Who would you vote for for this position if not yourself?</p>
<p>And, again...
Would you rather eat a live badger or have live jack russels for feet?</p>
<p><strong>21:15</strong> A member of the audience asks Kat to marry him and says he&#039;ll phone the Pope to make it happen. She turns him down to a huge applause.</p>
<p><strong>21:14</strong> Luke finishes off this round of questions. He notes that societies have their own presence and generally look after themselves. Praises Rhianna for making society forums more subject specific. Promises to destroy the stereotype about lazy student union officers.</p>
<p><strong>21:13</strong> Next up, Katy.</p>
<p>Thinks the society forums and communication with socities is essential to the Student Activities role... there&#039;s a lot of that going on...</p>
<p>Subject societies?  &quot;Brilliant&quot;.  Equal support is needed.
She&#039;s not sure what Brown said, but an intense role and certainly not an easy job:
&quot;Gorden Brown can, I dunno, take it where he wants to...&quot;</p>
<p><strong>21:10</strong> Rachel thinks YUSU should engage with societies more; suggests introducing a societies committee. Says subject societies are a good thing; stresses importance of communication again. Has a lot of praise for union officers, says they work very hard both within YUSU and in other student unions.</p>
<p><strong>21:10</strong> Scarlett first: thinks a distinction between sorting out and assisting societies needs to be drawn.
Thinks there are some very good society forums this term and that society communication is key and course reps should be encouraged to get involved with subject societies.</p>
<p>If B rowndid say anything, he wouldn&#039;t prob take any notice... the PM&#039;s got his own problems, there&#039;s some pretty disparaging things being said about him.</p>
<p><strong>21:09</strong> Current President and Presidential hopeful Tim Ngwena is here!</p>
<p><strong>21:08</strong> How do you aim to improve communication between YUSU and its societies? The second question was something about course reps. The third was, what would you say in reply to recent disparaging comments about student officers from politicians?</p>
<p><strong>21:06</strong> Scarlett thinks the YUM chair needs a bit more respect! And that they can do their job well, should have more powers and responsibilities.  Talking to RAG officers is key and he doesn&#039;t think all society admin should be online, but as much as possible without removing it completely from the studio.</p>
<p><strong>21:03</strong> Luke takes the stage again. He says the best way of not stepping on anyone&#039;s toes is to talk to them and have frequent meetings. He tells us he&#039;s &quot;a bit of a gossip&quot; and likes to know what&#039;s going on. Gives further praise to Anna Bucks, saying she knows things about media that he wouldn&#039;t dream about. Doesn&#039;t think RAG policies are part of his remit but would be closely involved and always attending - without stepping on toes. Doesn&#039;t think everything should be online; stresses that YUSU Studio is a useful resource and helps society chairs to know how things should be done. Says if you&#039;re emailing about things, you&#039;re stuck waiting for a response.</p>
<p><strong>21:03</strong> Katy doesn&#039;t have much experience in YUM, so thinks she really needs the YUM chair; will be essential in helping her in her role.  RAG policies will be run by RAG committee - so liase with the RAG committee? Whatever, she thinks it&#039;s a bit of a weird question and I agree.
Katy wants to emphasise the importance of society forums and wants what the socities feel would be best for them to go online, to go online.  If that makes sense. It did in my head.  Whatever&#039;s best for socities seems to be the general gist of her answer, which is good stuff.</p>
<p><strong>20:59</strong> Rachel&#039;s up again. Says she&#039;d liaise with YUM to avoid stepping on their toes - communication is key. Believes YUM Chair is an &quot;essential position&quot;; thinks there job is coordinating and liaising. Says it&#039;s a massive job and praises the work of Anna Bucks this year. Believes anything that isn&#039;t already online can be put online quite easily.</p>
<p><strong>20:58</strong> Some more questions...</p>
<p>As Student Activities officer how do you ensure you don&#039;t step on the toes of the YUM chair?
Should the YUM chair exists? What is the role?
How do you intend to carry out RAG related policies that are not under your job descriptions?</p>
<p><strong>20:56</strong> Last but not least, it&#039;s Rachel. Says colleges are a massively great area for fundraising, so if they wanted to fundraise for a non-RAG charity this should be looked at. Believes publicity is the key to increasing attendance at Hustings; thinks more general publicity from YUSU is needed. For ratifying a BNP society would look into past Union policy to see what could be done.</p>
<p><strong>20:55</strong> Scarlett next.  Thinks the problems have been misunderstood with ultra-vira law
Nick agrees with the others that a bigger room and greater publicity is key.  Mentions people watching on URY? Whoops.
First question he would ask to any student wanting a BNP society would be &quot;why?&quot; and admits he would probably try and stop them a little bit - that got a cheer...</p>
<p><strong>20:53</strong> By the way, if you haven&#039;t been following the football England are losing to Egypt. Sad times...</p>
<p><strong>20:52</strong> Luke answers next. He says if a college wanted to fundraise outside of RAG, he&#039;d ask them why. Notes that the RAG charities have been voted in. Says he&#039;d book Hustings rooms in advance to increase attendance, suggests Hustings have been poorly advertised but believes that they have been attended better than he expected them to be. Agrees with Rachel that if students wanted a BNP society, it should be allowed provided that the students involved are not breaching rules and regulations.</p>
<p><strong>20:51</strong> Katy&#039;s up now... she wants to encourage everyone on campus to be more involved with the nomination of RAG charities as colleges raising outside of RAG is very difficult within YUSU regulations
More people to hustings - bigger room! and publicity and awareness of course.
BNP society? &quot;You can&#039;t turn down people wanting a society&quot; - she doesn&#039;t feel it&#039;s within her mandate to turn down students if they were serious about it</p>
<p><strong>20:48</strong> If a college wanted to fundraise outside of RAG, what would you do it response to ultra vires law? How would you make more people turn up to hustings? If asked to ratify a BNP society, how would you respond?</p>
<p><strong>20:46</strong> Katy says she doesn&#039;t think you can have too many volunteers. Thinks she can develop on more projects to make sure everyone can get involved. Tells us she organised the RAG parade this year so has experience that would be relevant for Woodstock; she&#039;s willing to help the Woodstock Committee organise their event. Stresses the need for better communication, says she had problems booking things for the parade.</p>
<p><strong>20:46</strong> Rachel wants to work with Volunteering to organise the great number of volunteers and in relation to international students, she wants a greater number of volunteeering projects that don&#039;t involve CRB checks, as international students can&#039;t get CRB checked until they&#039;ve lived in the country for a certain amount of time.
She emphasises that supporting woodstock co ordinaters is the most important thing, again happy to do whatever is needed.
Bookings - Uni and societies need to work closer together; praises the new room booking system</p>
<p><strong>20:42</strong> Here comes Nick! He says we have far too many volunteers, so need to get more funding into the projects. Says international students can get CRBs to volunteer, and suggests working with the ISA to achieve that. Tells us he&#039;d do whatever the Volunteering Officer and Woodstock coordinator asked him to do to help organise Woodstock. Timetabling; he says it&#039;s a case of communication and that the university aren&#039;t very good at communicating with YUSU.</p>
<p><strong>20:42</strong> There&#039;s some exchange of money going on in the row in front...</p>
<p><strong>20:41</strong> Luke starts...
he thinks the problem with volunteering is lack of co ordinators, and that Activities need to work closly with Volunteering
Woodstock - sees himself as a dogsbody in such events; willing to help out with anything and everything
Wants to open the Dickson studio to a greater number of socities to reduce the problem of booking clashes buit thinks clearer communication is needed</p>
<p><strong>20:40</strong> Finished my can of Strongbow. Thanks again, Ollie!</p>
<p><strong>20:39</strong> Frecks, did you just text me? I&#039;m being told you love <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> and our &quot;entrepreneural flair&quot;...</p>
<p><strong>20:38</strong> More questions: How would you work with the Volunteering Officer to ensure that all students who want to volunteer get the chance? What is your organisational role in Woodstock? How do you intend to foster better communication between YUSU societies and university departments?</p>
<p><strong>20:37</strong> Luke is positive about <span class="theyorker">the yorker</span>... I think...
VERY positive about the number of RAG beneficiaries, what is it about the number 6 that these people like... oh, okay, thinks maybe one or two more should be added to increase the range
Emphasises Summer ball is a D&amp;S question, but wants to encourage performing societies to take part</p>
<p><strong>20:35</strong> Katy thinks it&#039;s up to YUM to deal with <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>; wants to increase focus on core charities fair. Says it&#039;s difficult to say if there should be less or more core charities. Believes Summer Ball is a tricky issue - if students want bigger acts, they have to be willing to pay more for bigger acts.</p>
<p><strong>20:34</strong> Rachel thinks <span class="theyorker">the yorker</span> is really good as an external media body... should sign the media charter if joined YUM
Believes more beneficiaries are better than less - students need to care, more likely to reach a wider audience with more beneficiaries
Happy to discuss Summer ball with DS officers but wouldn&#039;t take money from Activities for it</p>
<p><strong>20:31</strong> Nick answers questions first. Thinks <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> is good as external media to complement YUM; thinks it&#039;s up to YUM to decide if we should be ratified. Thinks six beneficiaries is enough for RAG as they all get more money. Says Summer Ball is an issue for the Democracy and Services Officer, doesn&#039;t think more money should be spent on acts though.</p>
<p><strong>20:29</strong> First of the ridiculous amount of questions</p>
<p>Opinion of <span class="theyorker">the yorker</span>? !
RAG - fewer beneficiaries and devote more money to each?
How would you get better acts for Summer Ball?</p>
<p><strong>20:29</strong> Captain Scarlett up next. Starts with some poetry, moves onto his six key policies. Wants a strong RAG with a strong college base; wants to make transport bookings and finances available online; says he&#039;ll make sure Kids Camp continues to run and promises to bring back SWAP. Also wants to increase summer opportunities for students, expand on Employability Week and work with the Careers Service, and increase daytime events for RAG Week. Finishes with another poem and a massive cheer.</p>
<p><strong>20:28</strong> Luke Malkin up next: opens with a joke over Stoke-on-trent...well, it&#039;s too easy...</p>
<p>Luke&#039;s using his Dancesport Presidency as an important point - he knows what it&#039;s like to try and run societies in spite of YUSU.</p>
<p>&quot;How&quot; and &quot;Why&quot; is most important, over &quot;What&quot;.  That&#039;s a fair point.</p>
<p>&#039;Lucky the Duck&#039; mascot to publicise Student Activities? Well, how can the candidates top that?</p>
<p>Malkin finishes by referring us to his web pages to check out his lucky Seven policies</p>
<p><strong>20:26</strong> At this rate, we&#039;ll be out of here long before 11pm. I guess Niall and Chiifen drew the short straw last night... although they did get to witness the controversy Pickard and Saul caused, and meet &quot;the other Dave&quot;, so I guess it wasn&#039;t all bad.</p>
<p><strong>20:24</strong> Katy Unsworth is up next. She believes university is not solely an academic experience and says we should make the most of every opportunity available. She feels a lot of students don&#039;t currently do this. She wants to make it easier for students to get involved in extra-curricular activities, and wants to improve society training. She also wants to make students aware of the changes to the charity law, and how this affects RAG and their core charities. Wants to push RAG and YUSU Volunteering to increase their full potential. The Pro Returning Officer calls time before she can complete her speech.</p>
<p><strong>20:23</strong> Rachel Hesselwood, Luke Malkin, Nick Scarlett and Katy Unsworth</p>
<p>Rachel is currently the YUSU Volunteering officer; very clear speech... emphasises what the position is not... ah, okay, she&#039;s not going to just reiterate the same old Activities policies.  She wants to set up a new society stall in the physics building
and introduce a society start up fund to help new societies to find their feet.  Emphasises that RAG and volunteering won&#039;t be forgotten... she seems very determined.</p>
<p>... and there&#039;s some huge cheers for Rachel as she comes to her definate and fairly dramatic conclusion</p>
<p><strong>20:21</strong> Did I just... see a panda?</p>
<p><strong>20:21</strong> Regarding Saul and Pickard. To sum up Lewis&#039; statement on the issue, they&#039;ve been banned from campaigning between 9.00 and 16.30 tomorrow for making comments that were in breach of YUSU&#039;s Equal Opportunities Policy.</p>
<p><strong>20:20</strong> The crowd seems very vocal in their support for the Student Activities candidates... no clear favourite though. Should be an interesting race.</p>
<p><strong>20:19</strong> Lewis Bretts has published a statement regarding Mark Pickard and Peter Saul&#039;s campaign for Women&#039;s Officer. More on that after Hustings has finished...</p>
<p><strong>20:18</strong> Oh, announcements - Charlie Leyland wants to remind us to register to vote for the General Elections</p>
<p><strong>20:17</strong> And we&#039;re back; Student Activities up first</p>
<p><strong>20:15</strong> Presidential candidate Matthew Freckelton has arrived. He tells us he&#039;s had a really good day, but that three out of four cash machines on campus were not working. He wants to work with Commercial Services to avoid similar issues in future, if elected.</p>
<p><strong>20:12</strong> 4/6 down... Student Activities and Democracy and Services up soon</p>
<p><strong>20:10</strong> Nouse&#039;s Jim Bulley is ordering Chinese from the Golden Dragon as I type this. I&#039;m wondering if this is a first for Hustings!</p>
<p><strong>20:10</strong> Ran into Student Activities candidate Luke Malkin outside. He&#039;s embraced the Sesame Street theme and is wearing an Elmo t-shirt.</p>
<p><strong>20:06</strong> It&#039;s a good thing I don&#039;t like Stongbow, Ben has left his can woefully un-protected</p>
<p><strong>20:05</strong> Actually, I take that back, after Mike Deniss has just referred to us as &quot;only <span class="theyorker">the yorker</span>&quot; . Cheek!</p>
<p><strong>20:04</strong> Oh, congratulations to any fencers who fought today from the first teams... if they&#039;re reading...</p>
<p><strong>20:03</strong> I&#039;ve (Harriet) discovered that typing fails are harder to avoid than I expected...</p>
<p><strong>20:03</strong> I think I&#039;m going to use these 15 minutes to go to the toilet... not the whole 15 minutes, obviously. Be right back!</p>
<p><strong>20:01</strong> It looks like Nouse are serious about ordering Chinese... I decided to bail though.</p>
<p><strong>19:59</strong> Break time! 15 minutes of freedom!</p>
<p><strong>19:59</strong> Robyn and Verity answer: Robyn says they will continue to campaign for a reduction of plastic bag usage. Says people want it to be easy to not use plastic bags. Robyn wants to open an eco-friendly pub, thinks this role might help. Agrees with David that her passion is more important; Verity also agrees, a member of the audience says he&#039;s proud of her for not being a geek. Robyn thinks her and Verity are both &quot;a little bit hippy&quot;. Doesn&#039;t think the stereotype is necessarily a bad thing, but wasn&#039;t to get past the stereotype to get more people involved. Verity is hoping to get more local stock on campus.</p>
<p><strong>19:58</strong> David... again...</p>
<p>Wants to propose a UGM motion for YUSU to campaign for the reduction of plastic bags on campus
Is doing this job because he cares about it; cites experience with Oxfam... would do it regardless of whether it helped his career prospects.
for combating stereotypes, Clake reckons wearing a shirt is doing pretty well (Kat&#039;s grateful)
He says he&#039;s really passionate about E&amp;E... I believe him.</p>
<p><strong>19:54</strong> How would you campaign for Costcutter and Your Shop to reduce use of plastic bags? How will this position enhance your career prospects? On a scale of 1 to 10, how much of a hippy are you?</p>
<p><strong>19:54</strong> David thinks the rising pop of the worl falls slightly outside his remit...
He&#039;s trying not to laugh now, trying to talk about family planning...</p>
<p>Fairtrade - E&amp;E been working on it over the last year, wants to expand the campaigning further</p>
<p>Campaigning for this position is hard as people are always going to point a finger and accuse candidates of damaging the environment...</p>
<p><strong>19:53</strong> Hmmm... should I open my second packet of Monster Munch...</p>
<p><strong>19:52</strong> In response to my comment about a Strongbow, Ollie Lester obliges. Cheers man! Wish you were running for something so I could vote for you!</p>
<p><strong>19:52</strong> Robyn says rising population is a massive issue, but doesn&#039;t think there is much her and Verity can do about it. Suggests people should use condoms more - that gets a cheer. Verity thinks its important that the university turns its good record into a &quot;really great record&quot;. Robyn thinks the university can set an example in terms of fair trade. On the subject of online campaigning, Robyn says it uses less energy than paper campaigning. Argues it won&#039;t be added energy because students will already be online.</p>
<p><strong>19:51</strong> Next questions are a bit of a mix...</p>
<p>Rising population is an enormous problem for environmental security... what can E&amp;E do?</p>
<p>Important to campaign for fairtrade, even though the UNi is Fairtrade certified?</p>
<p>Campaigning online? Uses lots of energy- isn&#039;t this a contradiction?</p>
<p><strong>19:49</strong> Verity agrees with David that it is not the responsibility of E&amp;E to implement Gaza but will look into getting more done on that issue. Thinks its fantastic that the university have improved their ethical banking but thinks more can be done, such as informing freshers about ethical banking. Robyn adds that the lake is a political and ecological issue that needs a lot of research. Thinks she&#039;d be good at looking into it as an Environment student.</p>
<p><strong>19:47</strong> David up again... he seems a little lost for words... not sure E&amp;E officers have any mandate for influencing anything to do with Israel and Palestine...
Personal involvment in the ethical banking issue, influencing the University on that score...</p>
<p>Lake=disgrace. Wants to use his good relationship with the Uni to work on getting it cleaned up</p>
<p><strong>19:46</strong> What will you do about YUSU&#039;s mandate to condemn Israel&#039;s attack on Gaza? How can YUSU improve its ethical banking? What will you do to improve the cleanliness on campus - the lake given as an example (filled with duck poo!)</p>
<p><strong>19:44</strong> David notes that he has also tried to use recyclable material for his campaign, but points out elections do need publicising. Wants to use the NUS to measure YUSU&#039;s environmental impact - has already started work on this.</p>
<p><strong>19:43</strong> &quot;Paper is bad&quot;</p>
<p><strong>19:43</strong> Heather and Hill think it&#039;s important to encourage candidates to recycle and reuse.  Online campaigning&#039;s important.  On 10:10, &quot;be persistant&quot;!</p>
<p><strong>19:41</strong> How would you promote the environment during elections? How would you get YUSU to fulfil its 10:10 commitment?</p>
<p><strong>19:40</strong> Verity and Robyn say they want to make a positive impact on campus. Want to reduce waste and increase recycling, also want more fair trade products on campus including fair trade condoms and ethical cola. Thirdly, want to make it easier to get involved in E&amp;E. Both candidates cut off for time.</p>
<p><strong>19:40</strong> David Clarke that is...
Seeking re-election... &quot;most enjoyable and rewarding experiences&quot; of Uni
Cites 10:10 and Greenweek as important achievements</p>
<p>he wants to make E&amp;E more accessible... thinks we don&#039;t have to all live in trees to care...
And he&#039;s timed out.  Shame, I was rather liking that speech...</p>
<p><strong>19:37</strong> David up first...</p>
<p><strong>19:37</strong> Environment and Ethics Officers next, then a break. A contested position - yay!</p>
<p><strong>19:37</strong> Consensus?   No</p>
<p><strong>19:37</strong> Someone has decided to ask if the RAG candidates can dance...</p>
<p><strong>19:36</strong> Jon gives a shout out to Mr. and Mrs. York for getting people involved at a college level. James wants to work with YUSU Volunteering but hasn&#039;t given the &quot;how&quot; much thought as of yet. Jon says he wants to get everyone involved, not just RAG&#039;s mailing list.</p>
<p><strong>19:35</strong> And again...</p>
<p>Does RAG need more college involvement?
Important to work with YUSU volunteering?
How do you intend to get RAG mailing list all involved?</p>
<p><strong>19:35</strong> Presidential candidate Ollie Hutchings has arrives, complete with his infamous red trousers.</p>
<p><strong>19:34</strong> James notes that the RAG and Student Activities Officers have different roles, but should be closely linked. Says his favourite beneficiary this year is Marie Curie Cancer Care.</p>
<p><strong>19:34</strong> Some more questions...</p>
<p>How should the RAG officer and Student Activities officers work together?
Fave beneficiary this year?</p>
<p><strong>19:32</strong> James says they&#039;re committed to the job but want a strong committee they can delegate to. Jon says both raising and giving - you can&#039;t raise without giving. James emphasises the strong committee again and promises him and Jon will be available whenever needed.</p>
<p><strong>19:32</strong> 1. If a member of RAG did not do their job, would you do it for them? or encourage them to do it  and risk it not happening?
2. Raising or Giving?
3. how do you intend to enact RAG policies that fall within the remit of RAG positions not your own?</p>
<p><strong>19:31</strong> James and Jon are really excited about running for RAG Officers. They&#039;re going to rap! To the Fresh Prince theme! &quot;We&#039;re just a couple of guys trying to do some good, gonna do fund raising in the neighbourhood&quot;. The audience loves it and so does Kat.</p>
<p><strong>19:30</strong> Events over multiple areas with wristbands?  Bigger is better seems to be the consensus</p>
<p>Non-drinkers?  Cites Fiesta, non -alcohollic bar from 7-9, before the vodka started flowing to encourage tee totallers to participate</p>
<p>Steven for a party-trick bared his chest... apparently he waxed it yesterday... something about Take Me Out yesterday...</p>
<p><strong>19:29</strong> RAG Officers up next.</p>
<p><strong>19:27</strong> Final questions: One big successful event or six little successes? How will you make non-alcoholic events successful? What is your party trick and will you perform it?</p>
<p><strong>19:27</strong> Disagreement between the candiates over Cheesy Pop and Indie... boos from the crowd...</p>
<p><strong>19:25</strong> Next round of
What do you think about the Service level agreement for ents - agreement between Uni and event providers about what happens after events
Safe alternative to Carnage?
indie or Cheesy pop?</p>
<p><strong>19:25</strong> The first comment on our blog offers us a takeaway. Yes please!</p>
<p><strong>19:24</strong> Answers to questions: Tony thinks variety and profit are the same thing. He doesn&#039;t see a clash and will maximise and prioritise both. Stephen thinks events on campus are a service to students. Stephen adds that they would actively support JCRCs and want to avoid college events taking place on the same night as Courtyard events. Tony thinks the ISA are an untapped resource currently.</p>
<p><strong>19:23</strong> Tony Richards and O&#039;Ryan begin by outlining their experience in college Ents... ah, here we go, as part of their policies they want to trasform the ents system, inroduce an ents booklet for colleges and set up crucial liasons between JCRCs and venues.  Apparently they hope to raise the profile of this &quot;fantastic office&quot; over the next year</p>
<p><strong>19:21</strong> Seriously, I find Tony&#039;s voice rather soothing.</p>
<p><strong>19:21</strong> Stephen and Anthony are both very well spoken...</p>
<p><strong>19:20</strong> Asked Ollie about the drinking game. Apparently it doesn&#039;t really work, but his plan was to drink whenever a candidate said something clich&eacute;. He thinks drinking whenever Jason Rose speaks would be more effective.</p>
<p><strong>19:20</strong> One student is slyly reading a book under the table... is work really that interesting?</p>
<p><strong>19:19</strong> Ah, break as those sport-inclined people decide to move off for football-watching etc...</p>
<p><strong>19:19</strong> Whilst Sam was answering those questions, George Papadofragakis, who ran for Democracy and Services Officer last year, entered the room. I still feel a small sense of pride every time I spell George&#039;s surname correctly.</p>
<p><strong>19:17</strong> Sam&#039;s one policy would be the 3-G pitch, which he thinks is feasible with a lot of hard work.</p>
<p><strong>19:16</strong> Ents up next!</p>
<p><strong>19:16</strong> Sam thinks non-BUCS sports need considering as they have to pay to play too, so should not be forgotten. He agrees that sport brings together students. Wants to open up the Sports Centre free of charge on certain days to get people to try new sports in a friendly atmosphere. Willing to back racism and homophobia campaigns but thinks York Sport campaigns should be prioritised.</p>
<p><strong>19:14</strong> Rob thinks BUCS teams should get more support as their costs are bigger and that&#039;s where Uni sport is played.  Need more money for college sport though
Absolutely wants sport to bring the whole Uni body together and would support such campaigns
wants to bring in volunteering oppotunities, especially York sport disability club to increase awareness - this is his chosen policy
Something that he&#039;s really passionate about
Sees sport as a &quot;force for good&quot;</p>
<p><strong>19:11</strong> Do you think BUCS sports should receive more support than Non-BUCS? Will you back campaigns such as Kick Racism out of Football and the anti-homophobia campaign? If you could only fulfil one policy, which would it be and why?</p>
<p><strong>19:10</strong> Rob thinks they&#039;ll be a difficult budget cut this year but thinks de-ratifying clubs would be the last thing to happen
Rob thinks it&#039;s necessary to work with college sport alongside Uni sport
World Cup Final.  Because he&#039;d find at least five people to watch it with him.  A subtle hint about the super bowl?</p>
<p><strong>19:08</strong> Sam&#039;s up first. He says the York Sport budget is &quot;fun&quot;, I think he&#039;s being sarcastic. He&#039;s against de-ratify clubs, would prefer to slow down the level of money being given out to clubs. Doesn&#039;t think cost should influence ratification. Thinks College Sport Officer is an important role and does not think York Sport President is a small role despite what the question says. As an American Football player, he picks the Superbowl. Booooo!</p>
<p><strong>19:07</strong> More questions being passed to Kat...</p>
<p><strong>19:06</strong> Would you be prepared to de-ratify clubs to save money? Why do York Sport need a separate College Sport Officer? World Cup Final or the Superbowl?</p>
<p><strong>19:06</strong> Sam thinks the sports centre realtionship is great, but is part of DFM and this is where the relationship struggles and this is where communication needs to be improved.
As a subcommittee, Sam thinks york sport needs to work closely with YUSU
Stop miscommunication?  Keep close and keep in touch with the bodies involved.</p>
<p><strong>19:05</strong> I feel like a bit of a girl opening my can of Rockstar when so many students here are drinking. This is Ben by the way, so I&#039;m not a girl.</p>
<p><strong>19:05</strong> Some students have arrived late, disrupting Sam and Rob slightly. Tut tut.</p>
<p><strong>19:04</strong> Rob would like to keep a strong relationship with the Sports Centre. Notes that it&#039;s a business as well as a facility for students. He does not think Union Council is the best use of a Sports President&#039;s time, but argues that it&#039;s &quot;the best use for now&quot;. He doesn&#039;t think he can change things with BUCS because there&#039;s a lot of confusion, but wants to improve communication.</p>
<p><strong>19:03</strong> 1 Would you be prepared to damage the relationship with the sports centre?
2. How do you think that york sport should work as a faction of YUSU?
3. How would he try and stop things such as what happened last week with the rugby?</p>
<p><strong>19:01</strong> Rob says he believes York can participate and succeed. He also wants to push top level sport. He would rather he had his desk in the YUSU Studio, so he can work with the staff there. He would &quot;certainly&quot; be prepared to miss his sport on Wednesday afternoons for YUSU commitments. He wants to meet all the sports clubs individually.</p>
<p><strong>18:59</strong> Sam thinks you can&#039;t have success without participation.  Thinks the sports centre desk is key.  Is willing to miss his sport on wedsnesday afternoon for YUSU because we are part of a Union</p>
<p><strong>18:58</strong> First questions... 1. Which is more important, participation or success? 2. Would you prefer your desk to be in the Sports Centre or the YUSU office. I missed question 3.</p>
<p><strong>18:57</strong> Sam tells us he&#039;s enthusiastic, ambitious and forward-thinking.</p>
<p><strong>18:56</strong> Sam begins by outlining his extensive experience with York Sport and Langwith College</p>
<p><strong>18:55</strong> Rob finishes his speech to loud applause.</p>
<p><strong>18:55</strong> He&#039;s dedicated, innovative, passionate and positive.</p>
<p><strong>18:54</strong> Rob wants to encourage and recognise excellence in sport. We were certainly excellent this weekend at Varsity!</p>
<p><strong>18:54</strong> Rob Newton opens the speaking. He does not propose any &quot;grand sweeping changes&quot;, but wants to build on York Sport&#039;s potential.</p>
<p><strong>18:53</strong> Democracy and Services candidate Sam Daniels approves of my Monster Munch. Win.</p>
<p><strong>18:52</strong> Kat has just reminded everyone that comments on the Nouse blog will be moderated differently from last night...</p>
<p><strong>18:52</strong> YUM Chair candidate Chris Young has arrived.</p>
<p><strong>18:50</strong> Whilst we&#039;re waiting for things to kick off, why not check out our <a href="../uninews/4404.html">live blog</a> from last night? Or, failing that, have a look at Harriet&#039;s article on <a href="../politics/4412.html">postering</a>.</p>
<p><strong>18:48</strong> Does anyone know if Ollie Lester&#039;s coming tonight? I&#039;d like to hear more about his Hustings drinking game...</p>
<p><strong>18:47</strong> As an English student, I&#039;m appreciating the rhyme in Nick Scarlett&#039;s speech</p>
<p><strong>18:45</strong> Attendance is looking promising so far; I was worried the England/Egypt game might affect things, but clearly YUSU elections are more important!</p>
<p><strong>18:44</strong> Shout out to Jim Bulley who&#039;s sat in front of me. I can see him checking out our blog!</p>
<p><strong>18:43</strong> Student Activities Candidate <strong>Nick Scarlett</strong> is kitted out in his Captain Scarlet outfit. He&#039;s also kindly given us a copy of his speech, and is dishing out paper ties and hats. I&#039;ve put my impartiality aside to wear one of the ties; I just couldn&#039;t resist...</p>
<p><strong>18:41</strong> Nouse&#039;s banner has been nicely coated in black tape; no doubt they&#039;re hoping it won&#039;t fall down again!</p>
<p><strong>18:40</strong> Tonight&#039;s running order is as follows: 1. York Sport President; 2. Ents Officers; 3. RAG Officers; 4. Environments and Ethics Officers; BREAK; 5. Student Activities Officer; 6. Democracy and Services Officer</p>
<p><strong>18:39</strong> Returning Officer Lewis Bretts is absent again, so we have Pro Returning Officer Kat to watch over things.</p>
<p><strong>18:37</strong> And we&#039;re alive and kicking! Deputy Editor Ben here, with Deputy Blogs and Comment Editor Harriet to my left.</p>

<p>re Nick Scarlett: as someone who helped ensure that kids camp went ahead last year, it&#039;s not a good idea for it to continue. There were many narrowly averted disasters and if anything worse happens then union trustees could end up with a criminal record (it&#039;s how the system works). Sounds like a nice policy, but as with many of the candidates ideas, it doesn&#039;t add up if you know the real story.</p>
<p>There should be unlimited RAG charities since at present only the RAG charities can have money raised for them. Make it easy to add a charity and then any society or college can raise money for the charity of their choice. This will raise the amount since they are more likely to fundraise for charities they care about. RAG raises more money, uni looks good, everyone is happy. Sorted.</p>
<p>A BNP society, if campaigning against immigrants and/or gays would directly contravene many YUSU policies and could be gotten rid of that way. But last years anti-fascism campaign was pretty crap so you&#039;d need to make sure you didn&#039;t just repeat it.</p>

<p>&quot;re Nick Scarlett: as someone who helped ensure that kids camp went ahead last year, it&#039;s not a good idea for it to continue. There were many narrowly averted disasters and if anything worse happens then union trustees could end up with a criminal record (it&#039;s how the system works). Sounds like a nice policy, but as with many of the candidates ideas, it doesn&#039;t add up if you know the real story.&quot;</p>
<p>What a pile of crap.  As someone who went on Kids Camp and Kids Club this year, it poses no more risk than many of the other volunteering projects.</p>
<p>Our union should be proud of this, it&#039;s been running for over 40 years, and we should be making a much bigger deal of what we do with this.</p>
<p>How about, as Nick suggests, making it professionally run, with student volunteers.  Win-Win.</p>
