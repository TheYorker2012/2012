		<div class="SubText">Rachel Hesselwood, Luke Malkin, Nick Scarlett and Katy Unsworth talk to The Yorker about running for Student Activities Officer.</div>

        
<ul><li><strong>Why did you decide to run for Student Activities Officer?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Rachel Hesselwood:</strong> I decided to run for Student Activities earlier this term. As I started thinking about handover for YUSU Volunteering, I realised how much I&#039;d enjoyed the role, and also began to think about other developments that could be made within RAG and Societies too. There&#039;s so much I&#039;d like to do to build on the work Rhianna has done this year with the position, which is still in its early stages of development.</p>
<p><strong>Luke Malkin:</strong> I&#039;ve always had a massive interest in Student Activities and i&#039;m so impressed with the range of opportunities available to all students, for example- I couldn&#039;t dance before I started university but now I run the Dancesport Society! Being in charge of a society of that size has been challenging, but so rewarding, over the past year- and I look forward to the many more challenges i&#039;ll face next year.</p>
<p><strong>Nick Scarlett:</strong> Over my last three years at York I&#039;ve been involved with many &#039;student activities&#039;. Starting with Kids Camp, and moving on through YUSU Volunteering, Kids Club, RAG, York Carnival and Cheesy Pop Soc I&#039;ve really enjoyed all the activities I&#039;ve done and want to help make them better. I&#039;ve worked closely with previous sabb officers such as Jamie Tyler and Rhianna Kinchin, seen what they do and want to make a difference myself.</p>
<p><strong>Katy Unsworth:</strong> I decided to run for the position of Student Activities because I feel that the involvement in the wide range of student activities on campus provides a brilliant opportunity for students to develop fundamental life skills. I believe that the reason many students do not get involved is not because they don&rsquo;t want to but rather they don&rsquo;t know how!  Therefore, I want to encourage students to take advantage of the benefits and opportunities YUSU and our student activities have to offer. Furthermore, I feel that RAG and YUSU volunteering can be bigger and better; I want to see them reach their full potential! Finally, I want to promote the slogan &lsquo;What can I do for you&rsquo; to encourage students to utilise YUSU as a representative body of the student population.</p>

<ul><li><strong>What experience do you have that is relevant for the role?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>RH:</strong> Obviously having YUSU experience as Volunteering Officer is really relevant - I&#039;ve worked closely with the current Student Activities Officer, so know what the role means from a part time officer point of view. I&#039;ve also got experience in running and training other people to run activities, through my involvement in Girlguiding UK. I&#039;ve always been someone who&#039;s thrived off being busy - and my wide range of involvement in activities at York (from facepainting at RAG events/Carnival to stewarding Vanbrugh events, and also University activities such as YSIS, LFA and the Student Ambassador Scheme) have given me a really broad perspective on activities at York.</p>
<p><strong>LM:</strong> Apart from being a society chair, I also recently joined the RAG committee. Previously I&rsquo;d only raised money for RAG by working with them at the past two York Come Dancing events, so working with them has been fascinating and I&rsquo;ve met a lot of new people who I wish I&rsquo;d met earlier in my university experience! This year I also joined YUSU Union Council- the highest decision-making body (other than a UGM) in the university and the communications committee. I&#039;ve never missed any of the meetings so I&rsquo;ve stayed in touch with the biggest issues, and next year if elected I would continue being a member of both of those committees- so I&rsquo;ve already got the experience needed to jump straight in.</p>
<p><strong>NS:</strong> Lots! In terms of volunteering I&#039;ve been Kids Club Coordinator for the last year, as well as group leading on two Kids Camps and I&#039;ll be running this Easter&#039;s Camp. I&#039;ve been RAG Charities Liaison Officer and ran this year&rsquo;s charities elections and also had a massive role in the running of RAG Week. I&#039;ve been involved with loads of societies as well - most notably Cheesy Pop Soc!</p>
<p><strong>KU:</strong> I was on Alcuin JCRC and the RAG committee as a RAG rep &lsquo;08/&rsquo;09 and then the RAG committee as Parade Co-ordinator &rsquo;09 to present. I have taken part in college volunteering projects. I am a member of the Uni swim team. I have vast volunteering experience outside of uni , such as, volunteering with kids as a swimming teacher and assisting as a poolside helper at competitions. Also, I travelled to Thailand to work on a volunteering project which aimed to preserve Hill tribe villages. Furthermore, I have always been involved in charity work from a young age; from raising money for Oxfam at a swimathon when I was nine to helping set up an Amnesty International committee at High School.</p>

<ul><li><strong>What are your key policies?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>RH:</strong> My key policies focus around accessibility and sustainability of activities. My vision is to have activities which are developing over a long term plan, and that are more accessible to the average student. To do this I will: - Create a new society stalls area in Physics/Electronics building (permission already granted from Facilities Manager Chris Teeling for 2 days a week from October 2010) - Create a society start up fund to assist societies that are initially starting (at the moment they have to gain membership money before being able to receive a YUSU grant) - Create links with the community that can be of financial aid - which will involve a &#039;Student Activities&#039; feature in the local press, which will hopefully engage the wider York community in student activities, and then I&#039;ll train societies/projects in sponsorship training so that they can use their ties with the community for financial gain. (Again creating sustainability) - Constructively support and represent RAG and Volunteering (from being a part time officer I have realised it is not the role of the Activities Officer to create policy for RAG and Volunteering, so I intend to fully support the part time officers and their committees, and fight for what they want)</p>
<p><strong>LM:</strong> I have a &quot;Lucky 7&quot; Set of policies. Lucky&#039;s the theme of my campaign, hopefully you&#039;ll have seen him around campus on my posters or online on my Facebook page. If you haven&#039;t, then he&#039;s a cartoon duck who wants to be the face of student activities. Through him, I&rsquo;ll be creating projects of the day that i&#039;ll advertise on the plasma screens, online and around campus. Personally, I hope I can get a costume to run around campus with at Roses, but we&#039;ll see :) I&#039;ll go through my other 6 policies a little more quickly, but if you want more details they&#039;re available on my Facebook group. They&#039;re not in order of priority, but are grouped:</p>
<p>1) Increase Society Storage Space- YUSU don&#039;t even know who&#039;s storing what, and where right now, so I&rsquo;m going to make sure we do so we can fight the university for more space.</p>
<p>2) Open the Dixon Studio - If we can get this space opened, societies like comedy soc and drama soc can put on events there. It&#039;ll also free up more space for other societies who&#039;re fighting for large room bookings.</p>
<p>3) Launch Techne - The student guide to running and maintaining societies. I&#039;ll write this over the summer so it&#039;s ready for the new year, and then will continually be updated.</p>
<p>4) Launch Community- The Anthology of Volunteering Experience, written by the volunteers themselves.</p>
<p>5) Untangle Ultra Vires Rules- Ultra Vires is ugly, and is knocking the wind out of the sails of fundraising, and I won&#039;t let this happen anymore.</p>
<p>6) Improve the Careers Service - Making sure the careers service work closely with activities so they can advertise opportunities to not just department mailing lists, but to relevant projects and societies.</p>
<p><strong>NS:</strong> My &ldquo;Super Six&rdquo; are as follows: 1 - Introduce College Based RAG Raids. 2 - Move all society administration online. 3 - Safeguard Kids Camp and reintroduce SWAP. 4 - Introduce an annual summer opportunities fair. 5 - Create a programme of targeted skills based training. 6 - Kick off RAG Week with a College Based Relay Race.</p>
<p><strong>KU:</strong> My key policies are; I aim to increase awareness of all student activities and make them more accessible to all students. Encourage more interaction between societies and committees, for example, RAG and YUSU volunteering. Emphasise the importance of societies forums, highlighting the slogan &lsquo;What can I do for you&rsquo;. I aim to create awareness and understanding of &lsquo;Ultra Vires&rsquo; and what this means for RAG and other societies. Promote the core charities fair and the nomination and election process. And finally, ensure the future of Woodstock as a RAG event.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Why do you think students should vote for you?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>RH:</strong> I think students should vote for me because my approach to student activities will have beneficial effects now AND in the future. My policies are all tangible, achievable and relevant. I have the experience and the enthusiasm to back up everything I do, and will put 100% effort into the job.</p>
<p><strong>LM:</strong> I&#039;m confident in both my policies and myself. Over the past few weeks alone I&rsquo;ve ran Dancesport, kept up to date with YUSU in committees, helped to organise the RAG Bash, rehearsed for fusion, joined the Pantsoc committee and represented the university in national competitions - so i&#039;m no stranger to being busy and dedicating myself to the university.</p>
<p>I believe my policies are strong. They don&#039;t all list things that already exist within the university, and they&#039;re clear about what they&#039;re doing. I&#039;m not just offering to &quot;get you more involved&quot; and not say how, or why. I&#039;m offering a lot more than just that- and I&rsquo;d strongly encourage everyone to compare all the policies of the candidates running for this position before casting your vote.</p>
<p><strong>NS:</strong> Students should vote for me if they think my policies are the best ones. Personally I think they are, and I think I have the experience. I think my focus on Student Development such as the Summer Opportunities Fair and Skills Based Training would benefit ALL students and not just those involved in societies, volunteering and fundraising - and I think my RAG, Volunteering and Societies Policies will make things better for those groups.</p>
<p><strong>KU:</strong> I believe that all my policies are achievable and relevant to the needs of our students. I am eager to fulfil every aspect of this position and learn more about our student activities. I am motivated and love being busy. Also, I feel that my friendly and approachable personality is well suited to the position and a relevant characteristic of a student representative.</p>

<ul><li><strong>What do you think are the biggest issues the university is facing right now?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>RH:</strong> Obviously HE funding is a massive issue for us, and nationally. Here at York, I think the transition from being a small University to a larger University across two campus&#039; is going to be important - I intend to take Student Activities to Hes East by campaigning for student use of the nature reserve. In terms of student activities, practicalities such as room bookings, space and advertisement are always going to be issues - but I look forward to getting into these and working out creative solutions over the coming year, if elected.</p>
<p><strong>LM:</strong> The biggest issue facing universities right now is the stability of tuition fees and its impact on the variety of students York attracts. Currently, I feel the university is blessed with its diversity and this is clearly reflected in the number and variety of International and Culture Societies on campus, as well as the range of games, activities and sports inspired by people from a huge range of backgrounds. I would hate to see this diversity taken away because tuition fees are a barrier to many would-be students.</p>
<p><strong>NS:</strong> The upcoming crisis in Higher Education Funding without a shadow of a doubt. Funding for all sorts of academic departments is going to be cut and with tuition fees likely to rise we REALLY need value from our degrees. That&#039;s why I want to make students aware of ALL the opportunities available for them and build on employability week and make sure they can utilise the skills their student activities experience.</p>
<p><strong>KU:</strong> The current issues surrounding Portering and the impact it is having on certain colleges! The development of Heslington East, and ensuring the students feel integrated into campus life. Preventing the loss of college spirit. Departmental cuts throughout the University.</p>

<ul><li><strong>A large part of being Student Activities Officer is dealing with societies. What societies have you been involved in at York?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>RH:</strong> In terms of membership I&#039;ve been in Concert Orchestra and PsychSoc. In my first year I stewarded and face painted at York Carnival, and last year I held the position of Assistant Head Steward for the Carnival. I&#039;ve also supported many society events -for example, I really enjoy going to see friends perform in the Drama Barn.</p>
<p><strong>LM:</strong> Dancesport (president, secretary, press &amp; publicity), URY (host), Panto Soc (committee member), Fusion, Happily Ever After Society, Central Hall Musical Society, Linguistics Society, Karting Society, Dance Soc, Astronomy Soc, Drama Soc, Comedy Soc.</p>
<p><strong>NS:</strong> Quite simply - lots! Obviously I&#039;ve been highly involved with Cheesy Pop Soc, typified by DJing several campus events at Vanbrugh and James, aswell as Access All Areas. I was involved with York Carnival last year and have had involvement with History Soc and wrote articles for Nouse, Vision and <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> in my first and second years. Also, volunteering projects run in a similar way to societies with similar financial and administrative worries, and I feel my experience as Kids Club Coordinator is very transferable to this role.</p>
<p><strong>KU:</strong> Other than the RAG committee, Alcuin JCRC and the Uni swim team I have unfortunately not taken advantage of other societies on campus. However, through organising the 2010 RAG Parade I have liaised with many societies. Similarly, through sitting on the Woodstock committee 2010, I will expect to communicate and work closely with our societies. I regret not making the most of our campus student activities in my first year. This is why I feel it is important to publicise our student activities and make them more accessible to all.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Who is your favourite character from Sesame Street and why?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>RH:</strong> I somehow missed out on the whole Sesame Street thing when i was a kid (I think Playdays was more for me), but after a quick research on characters I think I&#039;ll go with Abby Cadabby, because it says she&#039;s energetic and enthusiastic - which is a lot like me! (Cheesy or what!?)</p>
<p><strong>LM:</strong> Cookie Monster - I can go through a pack of biscuits without noticing it too.</p>
<p><strong>NS:</strong> I&#039;ll admit I was always more of a Playdays man myself, however - if I was pushed to choose I&#039;d plump for Oscar the Grouch, as I&#039;ve spent the last few weeks raiding bins for cardboard for my posters and towers, and feel I can sympathise with his life.</p>
<p><strong>KU:</strong> The Count, because I was never good with numbers when I was a kid!</p>
