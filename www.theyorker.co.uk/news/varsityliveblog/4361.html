        <p><strong>18:41</strong> You guessed it: the University of York wins Varsity! Yay. Thanks to all <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span> reporters for their fabulous contributions. Ben McCluskey, Marie Thouaille, Phil Mace, Niall Parr, Becky Ellis, Chiifen Hiu, Jonas van Tol, Jess Roberts, Leila Asrari, Harriet Evans, Niko Lavikainen, Hannah McCarthy, Tom Fitz-Hugh, Claire Curtis, Charlotte MacDonald, Lara Wainwright, Nick Evans and Rich Simpson.</p>
<p><strong>18:34</strong> I wonder who will be the overall winner... Not that it&#039;s obvious or anything. Brian Cantor is here to announce the winning uni. Fun fact of the day: apparently Brian used to be the captain of a basketball team.</p>
<p><strong>18:32</strong> The results are announced: Climbing - York win all. Rowing - York win all. Swimming - 9 wins for York Uni 3 wins for YSJ and 7 draws. Badminton - York win all. Tennis - York win all. Hockey - 1 draw, YSJ win 1, York Uni win 2. Netball - York win all. Volleyball - York win all. Football - YSJ win 6, York Uni win 4. Basketball - York Uni win all.</p>
<p><strong>18:24</strong> 5 YSJ dancers are performing now. They&#039;ve got nothing on York Dancesoc, but they can do higher split jumps than the YSJ cheerleaders. Good choreography!</p>
<p><strong>18:22</strong> YSJ cheerleaders take over in their matching American style cheer outfits. Apparently &#039;rocking the floor today&#039; they dance to a mix of modern music. I reckon in a cheer off between YSJ and York Hornets, the Hornets would be the champions. Not even close.</p>
<p><strong>18:18</strong> York Uni Trix perform an acrobatic &#039;fight&#039; off against one another. Using synchronised jumps and kicks, they role play a kung-fu/Matrix style combat. Not sure what I think of this...</p>
<p><strong>18:15</strong> York Uni Gymsoc begin the closing ceremony with a routine to Footloose. A few slip ups but some impressive stunts by all members. Loving the flips.</p>
<p><strong>18:05</strong> 10 hours later and Fiona Lavelle is still at it. New location: we are now bringing you live updates from the closing ceremony in Langwith. Gymnasts are limbering up the floor mats while YSJ cheerleaders huddle in the corner. I&#039;m getting excited!</p>
<p><strong>17:52</strong> We celebrate a resounding victory with a few more photos from our photography editor, Niko Lavikainen...

<p></p>
<p><strong>17:40</strong> Final score in the Basketball 94-39, final score in Varsity 84.25-19.25</p>
<p><strong>17:32</strong> Three minutes left in the basketball and it&#039;s 71-35 to York.</p>
<p><strong>17:22</strong> <strong>Basketball Men&#039;s 1sts</strong>57-32 to York Uni at the end of the third quarter</p>
<p><strong>17:19</strong> According to Emily Scott, the total tally at the moment is York Uni 80.25, St John&#039;s 19.25. Wohoooo</p>
<p><strong>17:17</strong> </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/4563.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/4563.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a><br /></div>

<p><strong>17:15</strong> <strong>Football 1A</strong> go into penalties. Reach 3-3 then in sudden death York No. 7 hits the bar and St. John win.</p>
<p><strong>17:10</strong> <strong>Football 2nds</strong> Final score 7-2. <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> likes</p>

<p><strong>17:08</strong> <strong>Football 1B</strong> York are ahead 3-2 with a goal deflecting off a St. John&#039;s player into the net. Flukey but I like it!</p>
<p><strong>17:02</strong> <strong>Football</strong> In the 1A game a St John player is booked for foul language. The player seemed frustrated at their inability to equalise and the referee asked them to calm down. He got TOLD!</p>
<p><strong>16:51</strong> Football fans are demonstrating their resilience as cold weather and light rain make it almost unbearable to watch. Sorry Yorker sports reporters! I&#039;ll buy you drinks on <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span> social tonight!!</p>
<p><strong>16:50</strong> <strong>Football 2nds</strong> York score again to a total of 3-0. On a roll!</p>

<p><strong>16:44</strong> <strong>Football 1B</strong> A great save from York Uni denies St. John a goal</p>
<p><strong>16:44</strong> York Football President and former Yorker Sports Editor Greg Gardner is watching the action from the sidelines today as he is too ill to play. He says he might make a brief appearance in the 1A game later.</p>
<p><strong>16:30</strong> <strong>Football 2nds</strong> 1-0 to the York Uni team and in team B. In all three games York Uni are up 1-0</p>
<p><strong>16:28</strong> <strong>Football A</strong> A brilliant double save by York St John&#039;s keeper keeps the score at 1-0. Bad times. Our Dutch correspondent/Football connoisseur brings us updates from the cold astroturf</p>
<p><strong>16:21</strong> <strong>Football A</strong> York scores the first goal. 1-0. That was quick!</p>
<p><strong>16:20</strong> <strong>Football</strong> Men&#039;s 1sts and 2nds teams have been combined and then divided into 6 aside teams called a, b and c. Updates to follow</p>

<p><strong>16:08</strong> Oy oy, Ben has a bit of a crush on the &#039;cute&#039; netball ladies. Watch out girls</p>
<p><strong>16:05</strong> <strong>Netball 1sts</strong> Deputy Editor Ben McCluskey is loving the netball. York Uni are ten points ahead with the score at 43-33. Is yet another York victory in sight?</p>
<p><strong>16:04</strong> <strong>Netball 1sts</strong> York Uni are up 40-32 in the fourth quarter. According to one player &quot;it&#039;s still very close but York are edging towards victory&quot;</p>
<p><strong>16:01</strong> Editor Fiona has learnt more about sports today than in her whole life. Who knew this was part of the job description?</p>
<p><strong>16:00</strong> <strong>Hockey Men&#039;s 1sts</strong> Game ends 3-1 to St. John&#039;s. Ah well, they had to win at something</p>
<p><strong>15:56</strong> <strong>Basketball Women&#039;s 1sts</strong> 46-6 in York&#039;s favour. St John&#039;s only scored one point</p>
<p><strong>15:55</strong> Emily Scott is trying to calculate the final score for Varsity. I reckon I know who won!</p>

<p><strong>13:09</strong> Down in the tent, the Netball team are dishing out free cans of Rockstar!</p>

<p><strong>13:05</strong> <strong>Netball 2nds:</strong> just over five minutes into the first quarter and York are 3-0 up. It&#039;s bitterly cold down in the tent.</p>
<p><strong>13:03</strong> In Badminton, Laura Suddaby and Paddy Clarke about to play, they&#039;ve both won their previous games.</p>
<p><strong>13:00</strong> <strong>Women&#039;s Volleyball:</strong> Victory for York University 3 sets to 0, last set won 25-5.</p>

<p><strong>12:51</strong> Here&#039;s a couple of pictures from earlier, taken by our Deputy Blogs and Comment Editor Harriet Evans...
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/4552.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/4552.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Harriet Hockey" alt="Harriet Hockey"  /></a><br /></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>12:49</strong> <strong>Women&#039;s Volleyball:</strong> York have won the second set 25-3.</p>
<p><strong>12:45</strong> <strong>Women&#039;s Volleyball:</strong> York are dominating the second set 14-1.</p>
<p><strong>12:43</strong> <strong>Badminton Mixed:</strong> York have won the opening game. Shortly before the victory was confirmed, a York player nearly got hit in the face by a rogue St. John shot, but Hannah McCarthy tells us they were all nice and apologised to each other.</p>
<p><strong>12:41</strong> Women&#039;s Tennis captain Maria Hunt tells <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> that the team are all going to go out and celebrate tonight. Hunt adds that they&#039;ve been doing well recently, and although they aren&#039;t going to be promoted this year they will finish high up in the league. Cat Hanrahan would the final match in straight sets, 6-0 and 6-1.</p>
<p><strong>12:37</strong> <strong>Women&#039;s Volleyball:</strong> York have won the first set 25-7. York won 15 straight points at one point... scary.</p>
<p><strong>12:36</strong> York St. John seem to be falling apart in the volleyball; from a York lead of 7-5, the score is now 24-6. Niall Parr says he&#039;s feeling sorry for them.</p>
<p><strong>12:34</strong> <strong>Women&#039;s Tennis:</strong> Hunt has won her second set 6-0.</p>
<p><strong>12:32</strong> <strong>Badminton Mixed:</strong> York 2nds have smashed St. John in straight sets. Hannah McCarthy tells me the noise from the Sports Hall is nothing to do with the badminton; must be the volleyball then.</p>
<p><strong>12:29</strong> York are currently winning the volleyball 7-5, but according to Marie Thouaille and Niall Parr (who are watching from the viewing gallery whilst I type frantically) the serving has been pretty poor so far.</p>
<p><strong>12:28</strong> People must be waking up; there&#039;s some very vocal support in the Sports Centre where the badminton and volleyball is being played.</p>
<p><strong>12:26</strong> Volleyball is underway and York are 4-1 up. At the rate it&#039;s going, this score might change by the time I post this!</p>
<p><strong>12:26</strong> <strong>Badminton Mixed:</strong> A beautiful drop shot by Liz causes the York St. John player to swear at himself in frustration.</p>
<p><strong>12:24</strong> Full time in the <strong>Netball Barbarians</strong>; York win 53-6.</p>
<p><strong>12:21</strong> Half-time at the hockey and it&#039;s 6-0 to York.</p>
<p><strong>12:21</strong> We can all breathe easy; Hunt&#039;s partner is back.</p>
<p><strong>12:20</strong> Hannah McCarty is covering the <strong>Badminton Mixed</strong> for us; she tells us there are some &quot;stylish smashes going down&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>12:18</strong> <strong>Women&#039;s Tennis:</strong> Captain Hunt&#039;s partner has just disappeared, midway through the second set.</p>
<p><strong>12:16</strong> <strong>Women&#039;s Tennis:</strong> And Cat Hanrahan looks like she is effortlessly volleying the ball around YSJ player Katie Drury. There&#039;s talk of a York player wearing a &quot;lovely Batman hoodie&quot;; more information on that as at when it becomes available, and maybe a picture if we&#039;re lucky.</p>
<p><strong>12:13</strong> <strong>Netball 3rds:</strong> The game is over, with York winning 53-10 and Olivia Coward picking up the man (or rather, woman) of the match award.</p>
<p><strong>12:11</strong> <strong>Men&#039;s 2nds Hockey:</strong> 6-0 now after 21 minutes. Driven outside the 23 yard line, deflected by Adam Tyrell into the top right hand corner.</p>
<p><strong>12:10</strong> <strong>Netball 3rds:</strong> Final score 51-10 to York.</p>
<p><strong>12:09</strong> <strong>Women&#039;s Tennis:</strong> Caroline Brown wins her match in straight sets, both finishing 6-1. This result confirms York&#039;s victory.</p>
<p><strong>12:08</strong> 5-0 now in the hockey; short corner, shot from the top D by Adam Douglas and deflected in by Adam Tyrell.</p>
<p><strong>12:06</strong> <strong>Men&#039;s 2nds Hockey:</strong> York are 4-0 up now and St. John are struggling. Short corner injection to top D, scuffed shot to left hand side swept in at the near post by injector Tom Norman.</p>
<p><strong>12:05</strong> <strong>Women&#039;s Tennis:</strong> Hunt has won the first set 6-1. Both the players and the spectators are complaining about how cold it is. I feel their pain.</p>
<p><strong>12:03</strong> <strong>Women&#039;s 1st Volleyball:</strong> The players are warming up, they should be starting soon.</p>
<p><strong>12:01</strong> 3-0 in the hockey now! Short corner to top D, slipped left to Will Fresson, who scores in the bottom left with an early strike.</p>
<p><strong>12:00</strong> <strong>Men&#039;s 2nds Hockey:</strong> Adam Douglas scores again, putting York 2-0 up. The ball came to Douglas at top D and he beat the keeper with a low shot into the bottom right corner.</p>
<p><strong>11:59</strong> Maria Hunt is 4-1 up in her set too.</p>
<p><strong>11:58</strong> <strong>Tennis:</strong> Ellie Arkle and Emily Brooks have just finished their match; York won this one, with Arkle beating Brooks in two sets, 6-0 and 6-3.</p>
<p><strong>11:55</strong> <strong>Men&#039;s 2nds Hockey:</strong> Six minutes in and York take the lead. Adam Douglas scores from close range and celebrates with a stylish cartwheel.</p>
<p><strong>11:52</strong> <strong>Netball 3rds:</strong> The score is currently 41-10 to York.</p>
<p><strong>11:48</strong> Here&#039;s a picture from the <strong>Women&#039;s 2nds Hockey</strong>:</p>
<p></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/4551.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/4551.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Varsity Hockey 01" alt="Varsity Hockey 01"  /></a><br /></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>11:44</strong> The <strong>Men&#039;s 2nds Hockey</strong> has started.</p>
<p><strong>11:41</strong> Exciting news from the makeshift Yorker office in the Viewing Gallery: Ex-Editor Marie Thouaille has arrived!</p>
<p><strong>11:39</strong> The start of the <strong>Men&#039;s 2nds Hockey</strong> has been delayed as we&#039;re still waiting for half the St. John team to arrive on campus.</p>
<p><strong>11:35</strong> Sports Editor Becky Ellis is watching the tennis for us; she tells us it&#039;s better in summer with strawberries.</p>
<p><strong>11:34</strong> <strong>Netball 3rds</strong>: 27-7 to York Uni at half time.</p>
<p><strong>11:24</strong> Just ran into former Langwith Chair Sam Asfahani in the Sports Centre. I told him I&#039;d heard he was slightly hungover, here&#039;s what he had to say in response: &quot;Slightly hungover would be the understatement of the year; I think I&#039;m still drunk&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>11:20</strong> Director Phil Mace is loving the hockey ladies. Sadly it&#039;s all over now, with York winning 3-0.</p>
<p><strong>11:19</strong> Hockey Womens 2&#039;s: Leila Asrari denied from close range by a sliding save by St. John&#039;s goalie. The game is almost over with York Uni up 2-0.</p>
<p><strong>11:17</strong> Men&#039;s badminton is over; final score 8-1 to York. This post also marks a victory for <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> Deputy Editor Ben McCluskey, who got the score online before Nouse Deputy Sport Editor Henry Cowen could send it in.</p>
<p><strong>11:16</strong> Netball 3rds up 18-3 at the end of the first quarter. York Uni is on a winning streak today!</p>
<p><strong>11:15</strong> Here&#039;s one of the posters the York badminton team put up in support of themselves...</p>
<p></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/4550.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/4550.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="varsity" alt="varsity"  /></a><br /></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>11:14</strong> Tennis players Maria Hunt and Cat Hanrahan beat St John&#039;s 8-3.</p>
<p><strong>11:12</strong> York score in Hockey 2nds after 3 goal line saves from St. John. The crowd are actively behind York - good atmosphere! That&#039;s what we like to hear!</p>
<p><strong>10:58</strong> Catherine Brown and Ellie Arkle have won their tennis 8-1 against the St. John pair. Cat Hanrahan and Maria Hunt are up 4-3 to St. John.</p>
<p><strong>10:55</strong> York uni women&#039;s hockey 2nds score again over St Johns. York Uni 2-0 St Johns. Leila Asrari scored both.</p>
<p><strong>10:54</strong> Women&#039;s tennis 1sts tied 3-3. Playing to 8 games apparently and no one knows why.</p>
<p><strong>10:48</strong> The badminton is over, with both the men&#039;s and women&#039;s teams winning their matches, 5-0 and 5-2 respectively. That brings an end to my own &quot;varsity&quot; with the Nouse reporter; I daresay I failed in my attempt to run up to the viewing gallery before he could text the scores to Adam Shergold and company.</p>
<p><strong>10:46</strong> Doubles Cat and Maria won the first game in the Women&#039;s 1sts tennis with York St. Johns serving into the net. 2-0 to York</p>
<p><strong>10:41</strong> More from the badminton: in the women&#039;s, McFadzean and Ward won their third game, whilst Moore and Tritasavet unfortunately lost their second. In the men&#039;s, Davies and Clarke won their second game after it went to a third set.</p>
<p><strong>10:37</strong> In the women&#039;s hockey 2nds, York are ahead thanks to a goal from Leila Asari.</p>
<p><strong>10:36</strong> Our rowing correspondent told us yesterday &quot;absolute rinsing of York St John in the tent by UYBC. Novice crews set the standard over 5km relay sprints, each rowing over St. Johns. Senior crews continued the winning streak with a tense 8km with senior men finishing only 8m ahead. Absolute trouncing from UYBC senior women winning by 750m, 3 minutes over the excuse of women that St. John sent. Overall UYBC are ecstatic, bring on the celebrations&quot;. Go York!</p>
<p><strong>10:32</strong> Hockey Women&#039;s 2nds still 0-0. The teams are quite evenly balanced with good defence by both sides.</p>
<p><strong>10:29</strong> The men&#039;s badminton team are 3-0 up; Hor and Tritasavit, Davies and Clarke, and Kanabar and Gatlenby all won their opening games.</p>
<p><strong>10:28</strong> Scores from the Badminton so far... sorry they&#039;re late. The women&#039;s team have won four of their five games; McFadzean and Ward have won one and lost one, Breare and Eyes won their opening game, as did Moore and Tritasavit.</p>
<p><strong>10:24</strong> Yesterday the University of York shot ahead of York St Johns finishing the day with a lead of 22.25 - 4.25. To read about yesterday&#039;s swimming click  <a href="../varsitymatchreports/4376.html">here</a></p>
<p><strong>10:20</strong> Hello Everyone! We&#039;re a little late due to technical difficulties but here nevertheless. Welcome to the Varsity 2010 Live blog!</p>
<p><strong>09:00</strong> And the coverage begins!</p>
