		</div>
		<div class="SubText">Nintendo&rsquo;s E3 conference took place on June 15th, hours before Sony took to the stage. Did they manage to improve on the dire showings they have had for the past two years? Read on!</div>

        <p>E3 stage veteran and President/Chief Operating Officer of Nintendo of America, Reggie Fils-Aime, once again stepped into the limelight for this year&rsquo;s conference, opening with a strong speech about how Nintendo has raised the bar and will continue to do so. Reggie explained that technology is only a tool (a nod to <em>Kinect</em> and <em>Move</em>?), and it is only when the technology is combined with the game experience that it really matters. With their motion controls already in place, Nintendo set out to show game after game, experience after experience that can only be found on a Nintendo platform.</p>
<p>Nintendo opened with the big daddy of their games &ndash; the new <em>Legend of Zelda</em>. The world premiere trailer for <em>The Legend of Zelda &ndash; Skyward Sword</em> played out on the big screen to much applause, and was followed on screen by the lord god of gaming, Shigeru Miyamoto (creator of <em>Mario</em>, <em>Zelda</em>, <em>Star Fox</em> and <em>Donkey Kong</em> to name a few). Miyamoto gave a brief explanation of the new <em>Zelda</em> before handing over to Phil, who began to demo the game on stage. At first it seemed to be going wrong, with Phil seemingly having no experience with the game. Then suddenly Miyamoto burst out from behind the screen to demo his latest creation in person, to a flurry of applause. Elaborate intro, but exciting!</p>
<p>Despite this inventive introduction, the demo was plagued with technical difficulties and ultimately seemed very underwhelming. Even with <em>Wii Motion Plus</em>, the controls seemed unresponsive and unreliable, with Miyamoto struggling to defeat even the simplest of enemies. The sword and bow seemed particularly twitchy. Miyamoto blamed wireless devices in the theatre interfering, but one can&rsquo;t help but think it was merely an excuse. New items including the whip and the beetle (a remote flying device) seemed more effective.  Miyamoto assured viewers that despite problems the game would play well on the E3 floor.  We will see <em>Zelda</em> sometime next year.</p>
<p>Reggie returned to inform us Nintendo&rsquo;s goal is to provide new experiences for everyone. He said that Mr. Miyamoto wants entertainment to transcend age, culture and gender; to have a universal appeal.</p>
<p>Reggie said one way to obtain this is through sports, and that one humble Nintendo hero has played many sports &ndash; <em>Mario</em>! We were then introduced to <em>Mario Sports Mix</em>, featuring beach ball, ice hockey, basketball and many more, sledged for a 2011 release.</p>
<p>Reggie then boasted about Wii sales, calling out false assumptions about Wii owners simply being casual gamers, and that with &ldquo;bridge titles&rdquo; such as <em>Mario Kart</em> and <em>New Super Mario Bros Wii</em>, Nintendo were ushering new gamers into the market.</p>
<p>The next &ldquo;bridge game&rdquo; is, according to Nintendo, <em>Wii Party</em> which uses Miis in 13 different party game modes.  The game looked absolutely terrible and only the most casual of players will even consider it. This was the worst part of Nintendo&rsquo;s conference, but at least it was short compared to the large segments given to terrible games at previous showings. A single clap in the audience is heard following the announcement of <em>Wii Party</em> &ndash; slightly embarrassing.</p>
<p><em>Just Dance 2</em> was also debuted for an autumn 2010 release. It looked OK, but considering <em>Kinect</em> maps the whole body for dance games, one can&rsquo;t help but feel this sort of game is already about to be superseded.</p>
<p><em>Golden Sun</em> for DS (first seen at last E3) is now revealed to be subtitled <em>Dark Dawn</em>. The game looked fantastic in the trailer and is being released this holiday season.</p>
<p>Reggie, being a master of wordplay, says that, whilst <em>Golden Sun</em> brings golden memories to many, to millions of other gamers &ldquo;golden&rdquo; has an entirely different meaning... the lights in the room fade... <em>GOLDENEYE 007</em> re-imagined exclusively for the Wii! Starring Daniel Craig as James Bond, an impressive trailer showing how the Wii has improved this classic game stunned the audience, and a release this holiday makes it even more exciting.</p>
<p>Next up was the introduction of an exclusive Mickey Mouse title, <em>Disney Epic Mickey</em>. Two developers showed off a level called the wasteland, which featured lost Disney memories and characters. The core game mechanic of the game is drawing and erasing, using Mickey&rsquo;s ability to &ldquo;control the essence of his cartoon being.&rdquo;  You can dynamically change the game world around you, and this adventure game incorporating platforming and RPG elements aims to prove Mickey to be the gaming hero he deserves.</p>
<p>Reggie then returned onstage to talk about Marahiro Sakurai, creator of both <em>Kirby</em> and <em>Super Smash Bros</em>, and addressed the fact that it has been too long since the lovable ball of fluff, Kirby, has had his own game &ndash; cue trailer for <em>Kirby&rsquo;s Epic Yarn</em>, a sidescrolling platformer featuring a world and enemies made from wool, string and other fabrics, which Kirby can interact with. Seems very unique and fun, and the game is on schedule to be released this autumn.</p>
<p>Several other big announcements were then made in succession &ndash; <em>Dragonquest 9</em>, a DS phenomenon in Japan at the moment, will see a US launch on July 11th, and a European launch on July 23rd. <em>Metroid - Other M</em>, developed by Team Ninja, was shown in an exciting new trailer, and will launch later this year. The team behind earlier instalments of <em>Metroid</em>, Retro Studios, has been working on reviving another Nintendo franchise &ndash; <em>Donkey Kong</em>! A trailer for the sidescrolling platform adventure <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns</em> for the Wii was shown, and Reggie informed us that &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going back to the jungle this holiday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reggie then moved on, stating that while many of these game announcements may take your memory into the past, it was now time we moved into the future. Nintendo is not just raising the bar, but extending it far into the distance.</p>
<p>NINTENDO 3DS - 3D gaming. No glasses (uh oh Sony... will PS3 gamers really be willing to don glasses with this technology around too?).
A montage was shown of the history of 3D (the most recent entries being <em>Avatar</em> and 3DTV). Now, with Nintendo, there is, according to Reggie, &ldquo;nothing between you and the experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smoke then filled the stage and a pillar rose out from the ground with a 3DS perched on top. Saturo Iwata, President and CEO of Nintendo, formally presented the new model to the crowd. The upper screen is 3.5&rdquo; widescreen, showing full 3D graphics. It includes a 3D depth slider; maximize or remove it, or anywhere in between.  The graphics capabilities have been significantly improved on the 3DS, and a slide pad has been installed for analogue play, along with a motion sensor and gyro sensor. One camera is on the inside of the 3DS, and two camera lenses are featured on the outside, enabling you to take photos and view them in 3D!</p>
<p>The new model is also capable of displaying 3D movies... again without glasses! Support is coming from Disney, Warner Brothers and Dreamworks, but no specific plans have been made so far. Nintendo once again stressed this is the first time this technology has ever been available without glasses.</p>
<p>Iwata then moved on to talk about Project Sora, a development team headed by Iwata and Sakurai announced in January 2009. This was revealed to have been established for the sole purpose to create a game specifically for the 3DS - <em>Kid Icarus Uprising</em>! A trailer revealed the improved graphics on the 3DS, and was met with huge applause. Best of all, initial impressions from E3 is that the 3D works! Iwata talked of the sense of height, width and depth 3D gives to the gaming word.  Furthermore, 3DS will communicate with wireless networks and other DS units automatically to install new stages, characters etc, without you having to download them proactively. No fee &ndash; free and easy.</p>
<p>The Nintendo 3DS will also feature the biggest launch support ever from third parties:
Activision: <em>DJ hero 3D</em>.
Level 5: <em>Prof. Layton and the Mask of Miracle</em>.
Square Enix: <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>.
THQ: <em>Saints Row</em>.
EA: <em>Madden and FIFA</em>.
Capcom: <em>Resident Evil</em>.
Warner Bros: <em>Batman</em>.
Ubisoft: <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed</em>.
Konami: <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>.
Many more in 3D!!</p>
<p>First party games are also being developed - Miyamoto is working on a 3D version of <em>Nintendogs</em> featuring cats too!</p>
<p>Iwata then presented a video showing the reactions and experiences of 3DS from developers. Finally, Iwata thanked everyone and walked offstage, leaving Reggie to present one final amusing trailer for the 3DS, after which HUNDREDS of hot girls came out from behind the stage carrying a 3DS each for audience members to try out. Demo units for <em>Zelda</em> also rose up in front of the stage.</p>
<p>Nintendo have literally added a new dimension to gaming.</p>
<p>Overall a FAR better showing for Nintendo this year than 2008 and 2009, and if the 3DS truly delivers then Nintendo may jump even further ahead of the competition. With franchise reboots and sequels, Nintendo are also sticking to what they know, and they will surely be successful in pleasing their hardcore fans this coming year, as well as continuing to capture a new audience.</p>
