        <p><strong>With October fast approaching, the prospective Yorkie will begin to witness the disbanding of their home social group, as each member leaves for pastures academic. Due to our generous term lengths you will be the last one standing, or sleeping, depending on how you choose to spend your holidays. Come late September, phone calls from your absent nearest and dearest will start to flood in, complete with accounts of events sparing no details. Such stories will fill you with both delight and apprehension, and you will mentally begin to embark upon the most surreal experience of your life. For the vast majority of you, this will be the first time that you have lived away from home, in independent utopia, as a &lsquo;responsible&rsquo; adult. As a consequence of this inherent freedom, many of you may feel the need to engage in activities that you may have not have had the opportunity to do so previously, but you should take heed, for letting a child loose in a toy store can result in enduring, and less than desirable consequences. Here are a few things to bear in mind before you embark upon an expedition into the unknown, alcohol drenched, sleep deprived, world of a university student.</strong></p>
<p>    Congratulations, you&rsquo;ve achieved what you set out to achieve. You should be very proud of yourself, for you are now a student at one of the top ten universities in the country. You have achieved outstanding results. Some of you worked hard for them, some of you did not. You have spent the previous decade of your educational life studying compulsory drivel you may well have despised. As the years passed, you were given more and more opportunity to choose the subjects you were interested in, or, more importantly, to drop those you in which you were not. Year after year, you would get closer to your final destination, but, like Tantalus, you would never quite reach it. Well, here you are, you have reached your destination. You&rsquo;re majoring in the subject you always wanted to, but is the pursuit of academic excellence all that university life is about? If you think yes, think again. University is a way of living, a way of being. Yes, your subject is important, but some would argue that the experience is more so. This is the time of your life, during which you will form enduring bonds that will last a life time, bonds that will transcend those of friendship, becoming more akin to those of family. I can assure you, without any doubt, should you choose to miss out on the social aspects of university life, you will regret it. Being blinded by apprehension, or crippled by shyness, is no excuse, for all of your fellow animals have been cast onto the same ark. I am not for one minute suggesting that you overlook your academic commitments, for most people are not of that rare species that can go out clubbing most nights, shun their lectures and seminars, then write an outstanding essay, or own an exam, fuelled entirely on a cocktail of red bull and pro-plus pills. If you treat your social life as a paramount priority, do not expect to excel in your reading, but treat your course as the be all and end all, and don&rsquo;t expect to be tagged in many Facebook photos. A first is a thinking man&rsquo;s degree; a third is a drinking man&rsquo;s degree.</p>
<p>          First day, you&rsquo;ve moved in; time to go about settling into your new home. My advice is to unpack your essentials and your essentials only. Spend too much time organising your room and you will miss out on valuable meet and greet time. Personally, I did not completely unpack until week seven, but I was perhaps a slow starter! The point is, go and meet your fellow students. As the opening days pass, the amateur Attenborough will begin to notice two absolute extremes, two antitheses, beginning to emerge; one, the terribly outgoing party animal, the other, the introverted academic. The party animal endures the dark of day in order to live the light of night. Labelled as the weird kid, the Brigadoon of students, the academic will rarely emerge from his/her room to take an organic smoothie from the fridge, maybe then choosing to exchange the odd greeting with their fellow kitchen mates, then disappearing, leaving behind a room of silent speculation. In hindsight, it is more desirable to strike a fine balance, sinking somewhere into the anonymous abyss that lies between these two very real stereotypes, rather than becoming one of them, but Hind did not have perfect twenty twenty vision, for, in reality, you will find yourself inclined further towards one or the other. After a few weeks, you will discover, as I did, just which side you lean towards. My alco-academic leaning dawned upon me once a friend asked me, &lsquo;what do you have on tomorrow?&rsquo; I responded, &lsquo;Ziggy&rsquo;s&rsquo;; head, meet desk. He wanted to know how many lectures I had, not parties.</p>
<p>    This friend would become my best friend at university, but, rather interestingly, he was not one of the fourteen people on my corridor, nor was he even one of the hundreds in my college, or on my course. He lived, a fifteen minute walk away, in Alcuin. I lived in Goodricke. I am a mathematician, yet a large proportion of my closest friends are English students. One of these friends, a girl I am living with this year, I did not meet until the second term. My point is, one need not restrict one&rsquo;s social group to those whom one meets in Freshers&rsquo; week. University is a three year experience for most. Whilst Freshers&rsquo; week will be perhaps the most eventful of your life, you certainly should not feel as though you have to become best friends with your block/flatmates and then slip into hermit like absence if they are not the people you wished they would be, but do take care not to become too friendly with these flatmates, for there is that one major taboo of shitting on one&rsquo;s own doorstep.</p>

<p>#19 I have already said I do not begrudge anyone going out. But when you start branding people who do not like to go out and socialise &quot;weird&quot; then you ARE in the wrong. Just because you do not understand it, doesn&#039;t make it &quot;weird&quot;. I&#039;ve been to ziggys before, and I would rather call it a slum than a nightclub. My friends enjoy the place, I do not understand why they do, but it doesn&#039;t mean I think of them as &quot;weird&quot;. I do not understand why they reduce themselves to barely being able to walk after a night out from drinking so much alcohol, I do not understand why they enjoy nightclubs so much, but it doesn&#039;t mean I consider them &quot;weird&quot;</p>
<p>I shared a flat with the individual who wrote this article. So do not jump to conclusions that I have not lived the student lifestyle. Resits are possible, yes, but not if you spent all your maintainance on alcohol. Resits are &pound;70, how can you expect to cover them even if you&#039;re struggling for food?</p>

<p>To be honest, #21, although your point is as equally valid as James Carney&#039;s and I have nothing against either position on drinking and socialising, you are contradicting yourself. &#039;I have already said I do not begrudge anyone going out&#039; - Yes, you did say that, but only when they &#039;drink in moderation&#039;. Really? People will grow up whenever they need to. If they want to be silly, mismanage their budgets and not remember anything from the university other than all-nighters on overdue essays, that&#039;s their problem. If they need resits they probably can afford if they are spending so much on nights out, that&#039;s their problem. Leave them alone.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not begrudge anyone going out for a good night and drinking in moderation, but when students go out every night to get drunk (the type who have overdrafts after the first 2 weeks of term) then it gets problematic.&quot;</p>
<p>Why should you begrudge them? They&#039;re not doing you any harm, are they?</p>
<p>I&#039;m not a big drinker myself, I don&#039;t particularly like the clubbing scene and would describe myself as fairly introverted. But, to be honest, your comment stinks of arrogance and, I suspect, jealousy that most people are less socially inhibited than yourself. And that&#039;s before anybody even mentions alcohol.</p>

<p>I do not have anything against drinking. If my choice of lifestyle was never attacked then I wouldn&#039;t be making comments like this. But when you brand someone who isn&#039;t keen on socialising &quot;weird&quot; then I see it as a personal insult and I have every right to defend myself.</p>
<p>Leave them alone? How about leaving  those alone that do not get a kick out daily visits to a nightclub, or take a pleasure in trying to pull every night?</p>
<p>I do not envy those that go out and drink or go out clubbing every night, even a introverted individual can drink themselves almost to the point of oblivion. I just take offence from the fact that the author thinks that anyone who keeps themself to themself is portrayed as &quot;weird&quot;. I am regularly branded &quot;boring&quot;, &quot;socially inept&quot; from some of my so called &quot;friends, because of my reluctance to go out. Who are they to say what is normal? Who are they to tell me how I should live my life?</p>
<p>Its all very well branding the quiet, shy one &quot;weird&quot;. But when the shoe is on the other foot, i&#039;m &quot;arrogant&quot;, &quot;jealous&quot; when I defend these type of people</p>
