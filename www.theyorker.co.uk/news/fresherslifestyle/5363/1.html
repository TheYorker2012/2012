        <p><strong>With October fast approaching, the prospective Yorkie will begin to witness the disbanding of their home social group, as each member leaves for pastures academic. Due to our generous term lengths you will be the last one standing, or sleeping, depending on how you choose to spend your holidays. Come late September, phone calls from your absent nearest and dearest will start to flood in, complete with accounts of events sparing no details. Such stories will fill you with both delight and apprehension, and you will mentally begin to embark upon the most surreal experience of your life. For the vast majority of you, this will be the first time that you have lived away from home, in independent utopia, as a &lsquo;responsible&rsquo; adult. As a consequence of this inherent freedom, many of you may feel the need to engage in activities that you may have not have had the opportunity to do so previously, but you should take heed, for letting a child loose in a toy store can result in enduring, and less than desirable consequences. Here are a few things to bear in mind before you embark upon an expedition into the unknown, alcohol drenched, sleep deprived, world of a university student.</strong></p>
<p>    Congratulations, you&rsquo;ve achieved what you set out to achieve. You should be very proud of yourself, for you are now a student at one of the top ten universities in the country. You have achieved outstanding results. Some of you worked hard for them, some of you did not. You have spent the previous decade of your educational life studying compulsory drivel you may well have despised. As the years passed, you were given more and more opportunity to choose the subjects you were interested in, or, more importantly, to drop those you in which you were not. Year after year, you would get closer to your final destination, but, like Tantalus, you would never quite reach it. Well, here you are, you have reached your destination. You&rsquo;re majoring in the subject you always wanted to, but is the pursuit of academic excellence all that university life is about? If you think yes, think again. University is a way of living, a way of being. Yes, your subject is important, but some would argue that the experience is more so. This is the time of your life, during which you will form enduring bonds that will last a life time, bonds that will transcend those of friendship, becoming more akin to those of family. I can assure you, without any doubt, should you choose to miss out on the social aspects of university life, you will regret it. Being blinded by apprehension, or crippled by shyness, is no excuse, for all of your fellow animals have been cast onto the same ark. I am not for one minute suggesting that you overlook your academic commitments, for most people are not of that rare species that can go out clubbing most nights, shun their lectures and seminars, then write an outstanding essay, or own an exam, fuelled entirely on a cocktail of red bull and pro-plus pills. If you treat your social life as a paramount priority, do not expect to excel in your reading, but treat your course as the be all and end all, and don&rsquo;t expect to be tagged in many Facebook photos. A first is a thinking man&rsquo;s degree; a third is a drinking man&rsquo;s degree.</p>
<p>          First day, you&rsquo;ve moved in; time to go about settling into your new home. My advice is to unpack your essentials and your essentials only. Spend too much time organising your room and you will miss out on valuable meet and greet time. Personally, I did not completely unpack until week seven, but I was perhaps a slow starter! The point is, go and meet your fellow students. As the opening days pass, the amateur Attenborough will begin to notice two absolute extremes, two antitheses, beginning to emerge; one, the terribly outgoing party animal, the other, the introverted academic. The party animal endures the dark of day in order to live the light of night. Labelled as the weird kid, the Brigadoon of students, the academic will rarely emerge from his/her room to take an organic smoothie from the fridge, maybe then choosing to exchange the odd greeting with their fellow kitchen mates, then disappearing, leaving behind a room of silent speculation. In hindsight, it is more desirable to strike a fine balance, sinking somewhere into the anonymous abyss that lies between these two very real stereotypes, rather than becoming one of them, but Hind did not have perfect twenty twenty vision, for, in reality, you will find yourself inclined further towards one or the other. After a few weeks, you will discover, as I did, just which side you lean towards. My alco-academic leaning dawned upon me once a friend asked me, &lsquo;what do you have on tomorrow?&rsquo; I responded, &lsquo;Ziggy&rsquo;s&rsquo;; head, meet desk. He wanted to know how many lectures I had, not parties.</p>
<p>    This friend would become my best friend at university, but, rather interestingly, he was not one of the fourteen people on my corridor, nor was he even one of the hundreds in my college, or on my course. He lived, a fifteen minute walk away, in Alcuin. I lived in Goodricke. I am a mathematician, yet a large proportion of my closest friends are English students. One of these friends, a girl I am living with this year, I did not meet until the second term. My point is, one need not restrict one&rsquo;s social group to those whom one meets in Freshers&rsquo; week. University is a three year experience for most. Whilst Freshers&rsquo; week will be perhaps the most eventful of your life, you certainly should not feel as though you have to become best friends with your block/flatmates and then slip into hermit like absence if they are not the people you wished they would be, but do take care not to become too friendly with these flatmates, for there is that one major taboo of shitting on one&rsquo;s own doorstep.</p>

<p>The point you make about being able to make friends other than those in your flat/block is a really good and important one. I think I spent too much time in the bubble of my flat during my first year, which meant that I wasn&#039;t able to meet as many people from other colleges or even flats in my own college. I would definitely change this if I could do freshers week again!</p>

<p>I am a introverted, non alcohol drinking student and I find the comment that catagorises my type as &quot;the weird one&quot; quite offensive. People need to realise that university life is just not about alcohol consumption and many friends can be made in all types of hobbies that you decide to partake in. Its a sad reflection of our society today that the typical student cannot hold one conversation without mentioning alcohol, and it shows how intolerant students are from anything but the norm.</p>

<p>#15, I highly doubt that the author meant any offence to introverted individual or to non drinkers. The article is aimed to the majority, and the majority of students will be drinking in freshers week. I think it is assumed that people will be mature enough to realise that alcohol is not needed to have a good time. No need to take offence.</p>

<p>#15 is a wasteman. The article doesn&#039;t say &quot;the weird kid&quot; is someone who doesn&#039;t drink alcohol, it says it&#039;s someone who &quot;will rarely emerge from his/her room to take an organic smoothie from the fridge, maybe then choosing to exchange the odd greeting with their fellow kitchen mates, then disappearing, leaving behind a room of silent speculation&quot;.</p>
<p>And frankly, whether this offends you or not, it&#039;s true. Someone who doesn&#039;t bother socialising with fellow human beings is wasting what should be 3 of the best years of your life. Get that stick from out of your behind.</p>

<p>#17 you are simply reinforcing what I said in my post. Anyone who doesn&#039;t drink or socialise is branded &quot;weird&quot; because it isn&#039;t the norm. Its YOUR opinion that people who spend the majority of time in their rooms are wasting their time. Personally, when I socialise too long it drains me and I get little from the experience.</p>
<p>I may need to pull that stick from my behind, but I think you need to pull the wool out of your eyes. When you are at university, your primary focus is to study and gain a good degree from your course. Recreational activity comes 2nd, but many students have lost sight of this. I do not begrudge anyone going out for a good night and drinking in moderation, but when students go out every night to get drunk (the type who have overdrafts after the first 2 weeks of term) then it gets problematic. Ever heard of the summer? I suggest that is the time to indulge in your binge drinking. You can&#039;t complain about the lack of time, you have a good 3 months to do it!!!</p>

<p>Get off your high horse mate, people are allowed to have fun if they want to. If you think the uni experience can be recreated in the summer when you&#039;re living at home and without 3000 other students around you, you clearly haven&#039;t experienced it.</p>
<p>You can resit the exam, you can&#039;t resit the party.</p>
