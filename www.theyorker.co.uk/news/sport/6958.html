		</div>
		<div class="SubText">Manchester United will take on Barcelona at Wembley in just over three weeks in a repeat of the 2009 clash which saw Barcelona run out 2-0 winners.</div>

        <p>United comfortably saw off Schalke 04 of Germany, finishing the game 4-1 up after goals from Darren Gibson, Antonio Valencia and two from Anderson. United started with a solid 2-0 lead they held from the first leg away in Germany, and Ferguson, despite earlier indications, opted to rest key players for the run in of the Premiership. United sported a new back four consisting of Rafael, Smalling, Evans and O&rsquo;Shea, and Wayne Rooney was rested from the squad entirely. Gibson and Anderson also featured, both relishing a first team start, and favourite Darren Fletcher returned to the bench after a lengthy layoff.</p>
<p>United controlled the game from kick-off, well aware that it was Schalke in need of the ball and goals, and the Germans&#039; desperation led to gaps that were exploited. Gibson set Valencia free, who rounded in-demand keeper Manuel Neuer to make it 1-0, and received his reward when he doubled United&rsquo;s lead just minutes later. This time Neuer was undoubtedly at fault, and he&rsquo;ll not be wanting to remember fumbling Gibson&#039;s ranged shot into the back of the net. It was a good night for Gibson, who has recently come under criticism from United fans, culminating in deleting a twitter account less than two hours after it was set up! But last night he showed composure and maturity, and his confidence will have been boosted no end.</p>
<p>Schalke hit back immediately through Jurado, who blasted a half-volley past Edwin Van Der Sar following Chris Smallings weak clearance, yet one felt they never really had the impetus to stage a worthy fight back.</p>
<p>After the break, United came out relaxed and focused, and Anderson&rsquo;s hard graft throughout the evening was rewarded with two goals. The first could again be attributed to a mistake from Neuer, who was a shadow of his former self who played so heroically to deny United in the first leg. The second was a well crafted team goal, culminating in Berbatov setting up Anderson to slide the ball into an open goal, leaving Neuer all at sea. Although Neuer will be disappointed with his performance, he is still young for a keeper just 25, and I fully expect him to move to a bigger club in the next few years, United will have a slot opening up when Van Der Sar finally hangs up his gloves so we may be seeing a lot more of him in years to come.</p>
<p>The night before saw Barcelona draw 1-1 with Real Madrid, which was enough to see them through to the final on the back of their 2-0 win at the Bernabeau. The game was bad-tempered from the start, Barcelona holding onto the ball with a fearless calm about them, almost daring the Madrid players to foul them. Madrid chased them all over the park in an attempt to gain possession of the ball, and fouls were committed. That being said, it was not pleasant to see Javier Mascherano, the captain of his native Argentina, diving after a supposed foul by Ronaldo thus ruling out Higuain&rsquo;s strike. He went down like he had been shot after a challenge from Lassana Diarra &ndash; Madrid&rsquo;s stand out performer &ndash; only to be up and running within seconds. It seems that South American gamesmanship is alive and well.</p>
<p>Barcelona opened proceedings with a move we have seen again and again and again. After numerous short passes, working the ball up the pitch, Iniesta weaved a beautiful through-ball between Carvalho and Raul Albio, and Pedro slotted home no questions asked. Real equalized though Marcelo, who hit home following Angel Di Maria&rsquo;s effort hit the post, but the one never felt Real had what it would take to overcome Barca. Captain Casillas looked frustrated as he pulled off some terrific saves to defy Messi, Villa and Busquets, but there was little he or his teammates could do. This time it seems the special one failed with his. He tried to graft for the draw at the Bernabeu in the hope they could snatch a goal in the second leg, and if it were not for Messi&rsquo;s masterclass it would have worked. Either way, Mourinho&rsquo;s behaviour cast a shadow over what should have a been five match series of pure footballing class.</p>
<p>And so onto the final, where United certainly have a task on their hands. Barcelona are not unbeatable, but discipline will be key, as will work ethic. Real succeeded in the Cope Del Rey final because they were able to stifle the creativity of Barca, not allowing key players any space with which to work. United have goal scorers, there is no doubt of their talents when they have the ball, but it is getting the ball from greatest playmaking duo in the world of Xavi and Iniesta, without allowing them the opportunity to set up the greatest player in the world Lionel Messi, for whom just one inch of space is enough. Game on.</p>
