        <p><strong>08:13</strong> Good morning York!</p>
<p><strong>20:14</strong> Aaand with the news that Kanabar and Hor beat Lancaster&#039;s 3rds in 2, that wraps it up for today&#039;s <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> coverage. It looks like history might be repeating itself as, with a points total almost doubling our own, Lancaster looks set to Bosworth our behinds...</p>
<p><strong>20:13</strong> Check this page out tomorrow to find out what happened with <strong>Table Tennis</strong> and <strong>Badminton!</strong></p>
<p>Also happening tomorrow are: Ballroom Dancing, Canoe Slalom, Volleyball, Cylcing, Running, Croquet, Rugby Union, Tennis, Football, Lacrosse, American Football, Basketball, Netball, Rounders and Karate!</p>
<p>Many many more events!</p>
<p><strong>20:08</strong> More success for York in the Badminton as Jenny Eyes and Clare Breare beat their 2nds in 2. Yum yum Roses points.</p>
<p><strong>20:05</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_draw.png" alt="Draw" /> <strong>Draw!</strong> Canoe Polo Polo Open <strong>2-2</strong></p>
<p><strong>20:04</strong> Results are in from Canoe Polo Open. And it&#039;s a draw 2-2.</p>
<p>There&#039;re only <strong>Table Tennis</strong> and <strong>Badminton</strong> left now.</p>
<p><strong>20:04</strong> More news flooding in from the Badminton courts - James Davies and Baillie Winterson beat Lancaster&#039;s thirds and seconds in 2. Noice. Emma S&#039;ari and Nattha Tritasavit beat the 3rds in 2, while Liz McFadzean and Becky Moore beat the 2nds AND 1sts in 2.</p>
<p><strong>20:02</strong> One really nice thing about this library is the way the toilets don&#039;t flush.</p>
<p><strong>19:58</strong> Table tennis mixed 2nds: Lancaster wins!</p>
<p><strong>19:56</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Canoe Polo Polo Womens <strong>0-6</strong></p>
<p><strong>19:55</strong> When Grace said we were growing to love the library I think she meant hate.</p>
<p><strong>19:54</strong> And he&#039;s just taken it back. Oops. Bit of emotional-screwing there. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>19:54</strong> Yorker&#039;s own Tom Fitz-Hugh speculates that if Lancaster win everything left to play today, they will definitely win overall! Bad times.</p>
<p><strong>19:41</strong> Just Grace and Chiifen left at <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> HQ. Slowly learning to love this library.</p>
<p><strong>19:37</strong> Hockey men&#039;s 1sts draws to an end, literally! 2-2. Well done York!</p>
<p><strong>19:36</strong> Yet another match for 2nds table tennis! First set to Lancaster 11-5.</p>
<p><strong>19:35</strong> Men&#039;s Canoe polo just starting!</p>
<p><strong>19:34</strong> Women&#039;s Canoe polo is over guys! Lancaster win 6-0!</p>
<p><strong>19:33</strong> SO (deep breath). Badminton. The results are in...</p>
<p>James Hor and Ricky Kanabar beat the Lancaster 2nds in 3 sets. Thanut Triitasavit and Alex Chu lost to Lancaster&#039;s 1st team in 3. Liz McFadzean and Becky Moore beat the 3rds in 2. Emma S&#039;ari and Nattha Triitsavit lost to the 1sts in 2, and Clare Breare and Jenny Eyes beat their 1sts in 2.</p>
<p><strong>19:31</strong> Mens Hockey 1sts - Captain Andy McIlwraith: &quot;Credit to lancaster they took their chances well, but we were in charge of that game and to be honest it&#039;s a bit frustrating to have only come away with a draw. Still, we fought hard so I&#039;m proud of those two points.&quot; And now that the day&#039;s last outside match is over, the rain has stopped!</p>
<p>Awesome reporting by Tom Fitz-Hugh. What a Man!</p>
<p><strong>19:30</strong> Canoe Polo: 6-0 to Lancaster! Probably something to do with having a pool to practise in.</p>
<p><strong>19:29</strong> Table tennis, and York win 3 sets to 1!</p>
<p><strong>19:22</strong> And one of the Lancaster lot just capsized in canoe polo but it&#039;s 4-0 to them after a few easy goals.</p>
<p><strong>19:21</strong> Mens Hockey 1sts - Final score 2-2. Lancaster and York come away with two points each. A terrific fightback from York to tie the game and Sam Asfahani is comforted by York winning the hockey overall. Glad to hear that the big man is taking it well.</p>
<p><strong>19:20</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Water Polo Women <strong>1-4</strong></p>
<p><strong>19:20</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Water Polo Men <strong>10-19</strong></p>
<p><strong>19:19</strong> And the canoeists are off, 2-0 to Lancaster already. They&#039;re like victorious bananas.</p>
<p><strong>19:18</strong> </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/4891.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/4891.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="fhaif" alt="fhaif"  /></a><br /></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>19:13</strong> </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/4894.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/4894.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="waterpolo" alt="waterpolo"  /></a><br /></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>19:12</strong> The sports centre is closing in fifteen minutes but Canoe Polo will continue regardless, to our correspondent&#039;s ecstasy. The staff are apparently uncertain about badminton...</p>
<p><strong>19:10</strong> Men&#039;s 1sts Hockey - Mark Inman shoots inches wide! Nooo!</p>
<p><strong>19:09</strong> Second and third sets in table tennis go to Lancaster, winning the match 3-0.</p>
<p><strong>19:06</strong> Men&#039;s 1sts Hockey - York are doing stirling work on defense to stay in it..and now they&#039;re on the attack!</p>
<p><strong>19:05</strong> First set goes to Lancaster 11-3 in the table tennis.</p>
<p><strong>19:04</strong> Mens 1sts  Hockey - York equalizes! Hell yeah! Nick Latcham connects to make it 2-2.</p>
<p><strong>18:59</strong> Mens 1sts Hockey - James Brandon scores for York! 2-1! The fight back begins!</p>
<p><strong>18:56</strong> Table Tennis: And the tables have turned! York win a match 3-0.</p>
<p><strong>18:56</strong> Lancaster win 19-10 in Mens waterpolo</p>
<p><strong>18:54</strong> Table Tennis - Lancaster win match 3-0. Boooo!</p>
<p><strong>18:53</strong> Men&#039;s 1sts Hockey - Lancaster have scored on a lightning break and right now York are on their back foot. There is still enough time left for them to mount a comeback! Fingers crossed.</p>
<p><strong>18:50</strong> Table Tennis: Yet another match. First set to Lancaster 11-0. Man we are getting beat!</p>
<p><strong>18:45</strong> 16-10 to lancs in the waterpolo at the end of the third quarter. Not looking good.</p>
<p><strong>18:45</strong> Table Tennis: Lancaster win 3rd set 11-4 to win match.</p>
<p><strong>18:44</strong> Table Tennis: Second set to Lancaster 11-3. Lancaster leads 2-0 in sets.</p>
<p><strong>18:44</strong> Table tennis: New match. First set to Lancaster 13-11.</p>

<p><strong>17:47</strong> Squash: York&#039;s fair-headed hero, who Grace thinks is named Ben has just won another game. Squirtle did the most amazing shot from behind Ben however at one point. Ben strokes wall and Squirtle shouts. Interesting characters these are.</p>

<p><strong>17:38</strong> Squash: Another men&#039;s match. A York player described only has fair-headed is playing Lancaster guy only known as short and tubby, nicknamed &quot;Squirtle&quot;, which sounds like a pokemon to me.</p>
<p>More is known about Squirtle the pokemon, he swears very loudly and throws his racket around. Also shouts &quot;HA!&quot; when he wins one, very Maria Sharapova, but male and plays squash not tennis.</p>
<p><strong>17:37</strong> Correction the score in the women&#039;s waterpolo is 2-0 to Lancaster. Sorry folks</p>
<p><strong>17:37</strong> Men&#039;s hockey 1sts has been delayed until, well, the actual start time to allow the final players of the york squad to get here after sitting exams. Unfortunately they&#039;ll be lacking supporters as everyone has headed inside thanks to the deluge here in Lancaster</p>
<p><strong>17:33</strong> York won the second set of squash but are down in the third. Waterpolo women at 1-0 up. If we can win that then 4 points in the bag.</p>

<p><strong>17:22</strong> 1-0 to Lancaster in the water polo. Apparently it&#039;s packed out in there</p>
<p><strong>17:22</strong> York and Lancaster working together for once as their brass bands play together. Looking good and sounding even better! The black suits and red/white ties probably help.</p>
<p><strong>17:21</strong> Squash: Third game goes to Lancaster&#039;s &quot;Le Grand&quot; (Guy wearing a Le Grand t-shirt). 2-1 to York overall.</p>
<p><strong>17:20</strong> Football men&#039;s 1sts: 1-1 at halftime. It is extremely muddy and slippery and it is still pouring! Sighted: Umbrellas and towels everywhere.</p>

She&#039;ll be able to update us on Charlie&#039;s situation as it develops but it doesn&#039;t look to be serious (thankfully).</p>
<p><strong>17:13</strong> Squash: 8-3 to York. And Paul has won the first game for us.</p>

<p><strong>17:01</strong> Men&#039;s 1sts football: York are on top and have created good chances, but haven&#039;t managed to score yet.</p>
<p><strong>17:00</strong> Table Tennis: The York supporters seem tired. Definitely being outcheered by the Lancaster lot. Though I suppose the fact that we&#039;re losing has something to do with it...</p>
<p><strong>16:57</strong> Men&#039;s Squash - York takes the second game in the second match 11-6.</p>
<p><strong>16:50</strong> Men&#039;s 1sts Football - The rain is making the play rather difficult but it still remains fairly even 0-0.</p>
<p><strong>16:49</strong> Men&#039;s 2nds Football - Its now 2-1 to Lancaster. A poor goal but they still count.</p>
<p><strong>16:48</strong> Men&#039;s Squash - I&#039;m reliably informed this game is a lot nicer in comparison to the previous one.</p>
<p><strong>16:40</strong> Down at the table tennis, apparently Rihanna was only asked to play an hour ago as there was an extra space on the team. She told <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span> how she used to play at home with her brother. Awww.</p>
<p><strong>16:40</strong> Men&#039;s Squash - Brennan wins the match in spectacular fashion 3-1. Good man.</p>

<p><strong>16:34</strong> Lancaster is rather wet! Definitely worse weather than in York. The rain is easing off a little, but it&#039;s still miserable and cold here. Mens 1sts football is starting.</p>
<p><strong>16:34</strong> Men&#039;s Squash - The hissy fit continues as the Lancaster player has now begun kicking the ball. Chap seems to have a few issues.</p>
<p><strong>16:33</strong> Yorker sports editor Becky Ellis says it&#039;s all very quiet and serious down at the table tennis. Lancaster have just won the 3rd match out of 17. Come on Team Kinchin!</p>
<p><strong>16:30</strong> Men&#039;s Squash - Brennan might have lost his focus a bit (I wonder what might have been putting him off). It now stands 2-1 to York.</p>
<p><strong>16:30</strong> </p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>16:29</strong> Womens Hockey 1sts - Quick flurry of scoring sees York still ahead 3-2.</p>
<p><strong>16:28</strong> Squash again - The Lancaster player seems to be throwing his racket all over the place. Sounds like a good spectacle!</p>
<p><strong>16:26</strong> Men&#039;s Squash 1sts - Some furious rallies have been going on and I&#039;m glad to say York are now 2 games up 2-0! To make things even better, Lancaster&#039;s players seems to have lost his cool and is now doing the squash version of John McEnore!</p>
<p><strong>16:24</strong> Fiona wishes she knew more about sport... This is like writing in a foreign language. Right, so York won the 1st game of the 3rd seed. Comprende?</p>
<p><strong>16:22</strong> It&#039;s half time outside at the mens 2nd&#039;s football. 1-0 to Lancaster at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>16:21</strong> Mens 1sts Squash - Brennan has taken the lead for York. Up one hand (I hope that makes sense).</p>
<p><strong>16:21</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Squash Womens <strong>0-5</strong></p>
<p><strong>16:16</strong> Women&#039;s Hockey 1sts - Charlie Bartlett has been hit in the face. Bartlett has already created several opportunities for York and she&#039;s been on fire throughout, we hope she&#039;ll get the chance to come back in!</p>
<p><strong>16:15</strong> Rihanna Kinchin has joined her brother on the table tennis. She has lost the first set though. Perhaps table tennis talent runs in the family?</p>
<p><strong>16:13</strong> <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>&#039;s video correspondant Michael Wilkins has informed us that there has been a serious accident on the women&#039;s hockey pitch. Apparently someone has received a serious injury to her head.</p>
<p><strong>16:13</strong> Squash - Men&#039;s firsts are limbering up for sessions in Lancaster&#039;s sweat box..</p>
<p><strong>16:11</strong> Squash - &quot;Two sweaty people slogging it out in a box&quot; Apparently..</p>

<p><strong>16:10</strong> In Women&#039;s Hockey 1sts, Imogen makes a fantastic clearance deep out of our own half after a fantastic save by our goalie. Awesome!</p>
<p><strong>16:08</strong> Atrocious weather in Bolton hampers the sailing. Only 3 races were completed. In the first, York nailed 1st 2nd and 3rd out of 6 to win. The second race, York won overall with 1st 2nd and 5th out of 6 places. In the third York dominated coming 1st, 2nd and 3rd. Great stuff!</p>
<p><strong>16:03</strong> In the minor hall, the table tennis team is warming up. Rumour has it York player Robin Kinchin is hot stuff. Outside on the Football pitch, the mens 1st team are warming up. Football correspondant Aimee must be freezing!</p>
<p><strong>16:01</strong> Women&#039;s Hockey 1sts - Bartlett wins another penalty which Emily Lucas capitalizes on to put York up 2-1!</p>
<p><strong>15:56</strong> The Women&#039;s Squash seems destined to go to Lancaster. Still, at least we&#039;re giving it a bit of gusto. Our second seed has gone down with a bit of dignity: 11-4, 11-3, 11-4.</p>
<p><strong>15:52</strong> With the Women&#039;s 1sts ahead in Hockey 1-0, Lancaster have managed to come back and score. Hopefully it was only a fluke..</p>
<p><strong>15:51</strong> End of 3rd quarter for the netball 1sts and it&#039;s 35-21 to Lancaster. Lots of tumbling and fumbled passes apparently. York looking quite frantic. Come on girls!</p>

<p><strong>15:41</strong> Hockey Womens 2&#039;s York has lost 5-2. York scored first goal from a short corner, with Leila Asrari striking and sally Warrington slipping it to the near corner.
Then lancs scored 2 goals  - one from a short, one from open play, slipping
it around the back of our defense. We pulled it back, scoring again from a short corner, with rachel Knighton scoring on the rebound.
However in the 2nd half they stepped up their defense and 2 of our
shorts were struck wide. They won three in quick succession and fought
their way to a 5-2 win.
All this from Hockey correspondant Leila Asrari</p>
<p><strong>15:38</strong> Over on the muddy, rainy football pitch, the women&#039;s football is still 2-0 to Lancaster with not long to go.</p>
<p><strong>15:35</strong> Mens 2nds football kicks off and Lancaster nearly score straight away! The ball was cleared off the line before the follow up was blasted off target! Good shooting..</p>
<p><strong>15:32</strong> Netball 1sts - end of second quarter 28-13 to Lancaster. Awful moment when someone tried to pass the ball to York&#039;s Goal Defense but she wasn&#039;t looking so it hit her on the side of the head!</p>
<p><strong>15:25</strong> Lancaster are still winning the Women&#039;s Squash and Harriet has just caught the attention of a few men from Lancaster to boot!</p>
<p><strong>15:18</strong> York has won sailing! That&#039;s an impressive 4 points. Is it raining in Bolton too? I suppose they get wet regardless.</p>

<p><strong>15:17</strong> It&#039;s 13-4 for the netball 1sts. Netball correspondant Grace Redhead says York aren&#039;t marking the opposition well enough. Go on then Grace, get involved!</p>
<p><strong>15:14</strong> Our football correspondant Aimee says there&#039;s lots of slipping and sliding in the women&#039;s football. Apparently most of the spectators are hiding in the tent. It&#039;s only rain!</p>
<p><strong>15:12</strong> Fiona has arrived! After a 3 hour history exam, the editor is here to relieve <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span> blog team.</p>
<p><strong>15:11</strong> Netball 1sts start out the first quarter. It&#039;s 11-3 to Lancaster. Come on York!</p>

<p><strong>15:04</strong> Despite rain and lack of spectators, 2nd half of women&#039;s football has started, and Lancaster currently lead 2-0.</p>
<p><strong>15:02</strong> President Rob Grant says he is &quot;Extremely please with the solid display in the 7s. Sets us up nicely for the 15s whitewash tomorrow&quot;. With a number of rugby players expected back after exams, York have good reason to be confident.</p>
<p><strong>14:59</strong> In the hockey York cannot finish. Still 1-0 as the rain pours down.</p>
<p><strong>14:58</strong> Men&#039;s tennis 2nds are up 6-5 to York, with only 2 matches left to play.</p>
<p><strong>14:57</strong> Lancaster missed a good chance in women&#039;s football just before halftime.Lancaster lead 2-0 at the break. And it&#039;s pouring! The sky feels our pain I suppose. There, there.</p>
<p><strong>14:54</strong> In the hockey York are very much in control but can&#039;t break down the Lancaster defence. Still 1-0 to York.</p>
<p><strong>14:52</strong> Lancaster grab a consolation try and conversion to take the tie to 12-7. York win two points there. Everyone heads to netball to escape the rain.</p>
<p><strong>14:52</strong> Ten minutes till netball 1sts start and Grace is concerned that all Lancaster girls have the same hairstyle. Hm.</p>
<p><strong>14:51</strong> Lancaster supporters on the side are predicting another lost for their netball 1sts. Apparently there&#039;s a general tearfulness going on among Lancastrians. They&#039;ve been given red roses and have been looking at them in a rather forlorn manner.</p>
<p>Grace is honing her spy skills as she&#039;s holding her phone really close to her chest so that the Lancastrians don&#039;t see what she&#039;s texting.</p>

<p><strong>14:45</strong> Lancaster have one of the most rotund scrum halves there has ever been. The fact has not escaped the watching York rugby squad who are pointing it out to him over a megaphone at regular intervals.</p>
<p><strong>14:44</strong> Netball 1st team have started warming up, obviously keen to make it an overall win for York. Lancaster 2nds&#039; goal defence is in tears.</p>

<p><strong>14:42</strong> Danielle has been a victim of a prank! Apparently York&#039;s men&#039;s tennis are up 5-4 to York in matches.</p>
<p><strong>14:40</strong> Netball 2nds. Final score 41-26 to York. Lancaster supporters moaning. Hey, you win some, you lose some.</p>
<p><strong>14:39</strong> York Men&#039;s Hockey 2nds miss a penalty. Still 1-0 up</p>
<p><strong>14:39</strong> Netball 2nds. Rapid passes up to Lancaster&#039;s inns makes the score 24-41. Lancaster make it 25 but there&#039;s only half a minute left. Early congratulations to York in order !</p>
<p><strong>14:37</strong> Women&#039;s squash: Lancaster win the first game 11-8</p>
<p><strong>14:37</strong> 24-40 to York now in netball 2nds. Lots of rapid passes on york&#039;s side but Lancaster are getting some decent intercepts. York netballers jump incredibly high apparently!</p>
<p><strong>14:37</strong> Our man at the rugby, Tom Fitz-Hugh tells me that Lancaster&#039;s attacking lines are appalling and York are smashing them back in the tackle. 0-0 in the mens firsts</p>
<p><strong>14:37</strong> We seemed to have spoken too soon. Clouds have appeared and its starting to rain down at the football pitches. Pretty quiet stuff in women&#039;s football. Lancaster still leading 2-0. I hope Aimee has a raincoat !</p>
<p><strong>14:36</strong> Oh dear, Aimee has just given me bad news. Apparently the last goal was from Lancaster and it was disallowed anyhow. Football men&#039;s 3rds finished 2-1. Oh well.</p>
<p><strong>14:35</strong> Correction the score was 12-7 in the womens rugby. It is now 12-12 as York manage a last gasp try but Emma Hodgson misses the conversion. She&#039;s in tears, but we&#039;ll take the draw.</p>
<p><strong>14:35</strong> Netball 2nds update. Grace is now on location! Wooh! 24-38 to York. Hall is packed. Big York sign at the back saying EAT SOME WIN! What does that mean actually?</p>
<p><strong>14:33</strong> Final score for men&#039;s epee 45-26 to Lancaster. Total score for men&#039;s fencing 135-110 to Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>14:33</strong> Currently blogging from the library in Lancaster. People are allowed to talk on their phones in here. No wonder we&#039;re 12 places ahead in the Times league table.</p>
<p><strong>14:31</strong> York men&#039;s 3rds football team have evened the score with 2-2. And it finishes 2-2! Great comeback York!</p>
<p><strong>14:30</strong> Tim Ngwena is smashing those cymbals for every scrum and men&#039;s coach Alec Porter shows what he learnt in the Edinburgh tattoo on the snare drum. Much good it&#039;s doing York in the womens 7s as Lancaster score a try and make the conversion. York have 2 minutes to pull back from 12-5</p>
<p><strong>14:28</strong> Tom Harcourt scores for York. 1-0 to York in mens 2nds</p>
<p><strong>14:25</strong> It is the end of the third quarter of netball 2nds now and York lead 32-18.</p>
<p><strong>14:25</strong> A goal for Yok&#039;s men&#039;s 3rds football makes it 2-1. Fairly even control of the ball at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>14:24</strong> York&#039;s Phill Sellars put forward beautiful wrist hits for men&#039;s epee. But Lancaster have just won men&#039;s fencing overall!</p>
<p><strong>14:23</strong> York&#039;s mens&#039; tennis are down 4-5 in matches.</p>
<p><strong>14:23</strong> Epee score currently 35-19 to Lancaster. York&#039;s captain from last year, Happy Whitwell seems happy to be in positive hits even.</p>
<p><strong>14:22</strong> York are creeping up on Lancaster. 63.5 - 38.5 to the hosts</p>
<p><strong>14:22</strong> York win Rugby men&#039;s 2nds 29-17!</p>
<p><strong>14:21</strong> Half time 0-0 in mens hockey 2s</p>
<p><strong>14:20</strong> Fencers are apparently having trouble counting to 5.</p>
<p><strong>14:19</strong> Frantic start to women&#039;s rugby. 7-7 apiece there in the first 3 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>14:15</strong> in the mens hockey 2nds York are looking strong in defence with Jamie Evans making some brilliant tackles. Still 0-0</p>
<p><strong>14:15</strong> Lancaster women take an early lead in football! And proceed to double their lead within minutes with a header from a corner. York haven&#039;t created much opportunity yet and Lancaster lead 2-0.</p>
<p><strong>14:14</strong> The mixed tennis team is warming up, just waiting for men&#039;s to be done!</p>
<p><strong>14:13</strong> Tim Ngwena and Ben Humprhys have arrived with cymbals and drums to rouse the troops. Tim seems confident despite York&#039;s current deficit, &quot;considering that we started 12 points behind we&#039;re doing really well. We&#039;ve got a lot of our better sports today like rugby, netball and hockey so hopefully we can keep the resurgence going and turn this round. G, York!&quot;. Well said</p>
<p><strong>14:13</strong> Apparently a Lancaster player&#039;s taken a fall and twisted her ankle... Some frantic playing going on.</p>
<p><strong>14:11</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Rugby Union 7s Mens 3rd <strong>24-19</strong></p>
<p><strong>14:11</strong> Netball, 20-12 to York and Lancaster is apparently cracking the ol&#039; intimidation tactics out again.</p>
<p><strong>14:10</strong> Lancaster win first set of men&#039;s 2nds tennis.</p>
<p><strong>14:08</strong> Half time in the 2nds netball and York are pulling away with a cheeky 19 goals to Lancaster&#039;s 11. Two Roses points up for grabs here.</p>
<p><strong>14:08</strong> Lancaster winning men&#039;s epee 23-10.</p>
<p><strong>14:07</strong> Football men&#039;s 3rds. Another goal for Lancaster! But not quite, as it is disqualified. Be satified with your 2-0 lead Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>14:05</strong> Lancaster dominate men&#039;s tennis, winning singles 6-0 and 6-1.</p>
<p><strong>14:03</strong> Men&#039;s 3rds football looking pretty quiet since the 2nd goal. Still 2-0.</p>
<p><strong>14:00</strong> York win a match in the mens 2s squash 3 -1</p>
<p><strong>14:00</strong> Apparently some fast and furious play going on at the 2nds netball, 14-8 to York... Would be good if we could win, our score&#039;s still looking pretty unhealthy at 36.5.</p>
<p><strong>13:57</strong> Lancaster lead in men&#039;s epee.</p>
<p><strong>13:55</strong> And the first ambulance of the day has been sighted. No sirens though....</p>
<p><strong>13:55</strong> Women&#039;s football is set to kick off at 2pm. Aimee is telling me they&#039;re looking confident now as they warm up. Lots of Lancaster flags around. Apparently they feel the need to remind us that we are indeed in Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>13:55</strong> York winning the current squash match 2 games to one</p>
<p><strong>13:53</strong> Lancaster football men&#039;s 3rds double their score immediately after halftime restart. 2-0 to Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>13:53</strong> York are 9-6 ahead in the Netball 2nds match and hoping to widen that gap...</p>
<p><strong>13:52</strong> Men&#039;s epee is about to begin. Lancaster president Aaron Gardner is on first. He&#039;s pretty good apparently. He used to fence for Great Britain back in the day.</p>
<p><strong>13:47</strong> Lancaster win men&#039;s foil 45-40. Epee left. Lancaster 7 ahead in total for men.</p>
<p><strong>13:46</strong> Half-time football men&#039;s 3rds. 1-0 Lancaster. Lancaster hit the side netting just before whistle blew. No clear chances for York so far.</p>
<p><strong>13:44</strong> It&#039;s the final showdown for men&#039;s foil. Lancaster leading.</p>
<p><strong>13:43</strong> Football men&#039;s 3rds. Lancaster takes a well-deserved lead just before half time. Lancaster 1-0 York.</p>

<p><strong>19:48</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Hockey Womens 2nd <strong>3-2</strong></p>
<p><strong>13:38</strong> Archery news - in the individual mens Lancaster have stormed ahead, but York look likely for 2 points in the individual womens. It looks likely that Lancaster will take 8 points from archery and York 2.</p>
<p><strong>13:36</strong> Football men&#039;s 3rds. Another chance for Lancaster after a fantastic break, but shot is off target. York is holding on 0-0.</p>
<p><strong>13:35</strong> Things are looking good for four potential Roses points over at Bolton Sailing Club. York&#039;s won two races so far with three more to go, though word on the ground says &quot;the wind is shit&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>13:31</strong> In squash Lancaster win the first match of the men&#039;s seconds 3-1</p>
<p><strong>13:31</strong> Football men&#039;s 3rds: Goal line clearance by York as Lancaster hound their goal. It&#039;s all one way the moment but scoreline is still 0-0!</p>
<p><strong>13:27</strong> Score is now 30-21 to Lancaster in men&#039;s foil.</p>
<p><strong>13:26</strong> Lancaster in the lead in squash 2 games to 1</p>
<p><strong>13:26</strong> Football: Lancaster dominates and hit the post but then York scramble the ball away! Ahhh!! My nerves can&#039;t take this!</p>
<p><strong>13:23</strong> Men&#039;s tennis saw York win 2 doubles and lost 1. Warming up now for mixed, and men are starting their singles now. Don&#039;t suppose this will be quite Wimbledon standard would it?</p>
<p><strong>13:22</strong> Football games are always so noisy! Lots of passionate screaming and encouragements from both teams!</p>
<p><strong>13:20</strong> Good play from both football teams in men&#039;s 3rds and Lancaster come closest to scoring with a corner. But 0-0 so far!</p>
<p><strong>13:20</strong> Emily Scott is absolutely ecstatic - she is literally, yes LITERALLY bouncing all over the place! &quot;I&#039;m over the moon! It&#039;s my last ever match for sucha great uni team and to get the winner makes it personally so special. I just hope the rest of the day carries on like this WOOOH!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>13:19</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Netball 3rd Team <strong>42-34</strong></p>
<p><strong>13:19</strong> Lancaster leads 25-14 after a 5-0 bout between Seb of Lancaster and James of York for men&#039;s foil.</p>
<p><strong>13:17</strong> Lancaster are pressing York in the netball as the scores edge closer - 40-33 to York... Tension apparently unbearable.</p>
<p><strong>13:16</strong> Men&#039;s first team is currently at 20-14 to Lancaster after the 4th bout.</p>
<p><strong>13:14</strong> According to wikipedia squash is the world&#039;s healthiest sport. It&#039;s 2 games each in the mens.</p>
<p><strong>13:14</strong> YORK HOLD ON IN THE HOCKEY. A thrilling last 5 minutes sees York hold off a late Lancaster fightback. 3 -2 in the womens 2nds. GET IN</p>
<p><strong>13:13</strong> Lancaster wins men&#039;s sabre 45-43.</p>
<p><strong>13:12</strong> 39-30 in netball... TICK FASTER TIME dammit.</p>
<p><strong>13:12</strong> Huge crowd gathering to watch the men&#039;s 3rds football but nothing much seems to be happening.</p>
<p><strong>13:11</strong> Current roses standings are 63.5 Lancaster - 33.5 York. With more and more York players being freed up from exams, maybe, just maybe we could pull a few more points back and make this a close run thing</p>
<p><strong>13:11</strong> It&#039;s almost over at netball and the score&#039;s 36-28! Today&#039;s looking to be a lot better for York.</p>
<p><strong>13:09</strong> And the word on the ground is that Emily Scott is a defensive machine right now. COME ON YORK</p>
<p><strong>13:08</strong> Crowds are starting to gather at the squash courts!</p>
<p><strong>13:07</strong> And Lancaster pull another back. 4 minutes left on the clock, can we hold on?</p>
<p><strong>13:06</strong> And Lancaster pull one back almost instantly. Surely that must only be a consolation goal. Please let it only be a consolation goal. York need the points.</p>
<p><strong>13:04</strong> York Sport supremo Emily Scott scores to make it 3-0 in the women&#039;s hockey 2nds, which, with 5 minutes left, should guarantee the points for York.</p>
<p><strong>13:03</strong> Women&#039;s fencing is 133-102 overall to Lancaster</p>
<p><strong>13:02</strong> The Roses equivalent of Brassed Off is currently unfolding at the ironically named &#039;opening ceremony&#039; with York and Lancaster brass bands facing off against each other. They really are pushing the definition of sport this year.</p>
<p><strong>13:02</strong> Third quarter of Netball coming to a close and York are still up, 37-27.</p>
<p><strong>13:01</strong> Men&#039;s 3rd football is just kicking off! The sun is shining, footballers are playing. Hopefully it will be an exciting match and York can take home points!</p>
<p><strong>13:01</strong> York women have won epee 45-43! Whoop</p>
<p><strong>13:00</strong> Football has just started!</p>
<p><strong>12:59</strong> Amy tells us they&#039;re now playing the Match of the Day theme tune. &quot;And the sun is out too!&quot; Shush Amy.</p>
<p><strong>12:58</strong> In tennis men, York has won doubles 8-4! Go York!</p>
<p><strong>12:57</strong> The brass band opens with the Rocky Balboa theme tune! Clearly gunning for the underdog. Hopefully that will inspire York this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>12:54</strong> Just looking at the March BUCS results for trampolining and it seems Lancaster didn&#039;t enter a single competitor. York only entered three, Rebecca Pedley for Womens 1sts, who didn&#039;t place, Katie Birmingham for 2nds, who came 42nd out of 66, and Jonathan Ward for Men&#039;s 3rds, who came 5th out of 13. Not sure who&#039;s competing for York this time but that doesn&#039;t look promising for Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>12:52</strong> York keeper Claire Kirkby saves a contentious penalty flick. That could be costly as Lancaster have already missed another penalty today. 2-0 in the womens 2nds hockey</p>
<p><strong>12:52</strong> Over by the football pitches the brass band is setting up for the opening ceremony, which should start soon. Lots of smoke in the air from the barbeques and general merriment. Meanwhile, in the library...</p>
<p><strong>12:50</strong> Mens sabre 45 - 43 to lancaster</p>
<p><strong>12:48</strong> York still leading in the netball, 26-20 to us. Hopefully we can hold on to it.</p>
<p><strong>12:44</strong> 43 all for men&#039;s sabre !</p>
<p><strong>12:43</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Volleyball Mixed <strong>3-2</strong></p>
<p><strong>12:42</strong> York go 2-0 up in hockey womens 2s through captain Kate Dewar</p>
<p><strong>12:41</strong> York pulling ahead in the netball to 24-16 and it&#039;s half time. Goals flying. Or dropping I guess, through the hoops. Whatever it is it is GOOD.</p>
<p><strong>12:36</strong> Women&#039;s epee has just been won by Lancaster overall.</p>
<p><strong>12:35</strong> York netball thirds leading 17-13!! Lancaster&#039;s supporters have been silenced by York&#039;s comeback.</p>
<p><strong>12:35</strong> Netball and Lancaster leading at the end of the second quarter. 11-10, massive pullback from York as they finally settle into their game.</p>
<p><strong>12:34</strong> And its 35-23 in the fencing now</p>
<p><strong>12:34</strong> Nothing much going on in trampolining yet. It&#039;s one of the latest additions to the BUCS lineup. Apparently it was especially popular in the USSR and Communist China. Not really sure what to make of that.</p>
<p><strong>12:31</strong> Half time in women&#039;s 2nds hockey, with York holding on to their early 1-0 lead. They haven&#039;t had much possession but Tom tells me their defence has been solid</p>
<p><strong>12:30</strong> Becky Ellis has just finished Epee 5-1 to York.</p>
<p><strong>12:28</strong> Start of the second quarter in netball, York equalised and have possession. Match paused due to scoreboard problems.</p>
<p><strong>12:27</strong> 30 - 19 in fencing now to York. Team captain Tom didn&#039;t drop any points</p>
<p><strong>12:25</strong> In the fencing York are leading 25 - 19</p>
<p><strong>12:25</strong> It&#039;s close, 10-9, in the netball.</p>
<p><strong>12:24</strong> Women&#039;s sabre has been won by Lancaster 45-21.</p>
<p><strong>12:22</strong> 8-7 to Lancaster in netball, York trying to recover from a slow start.</p>
<p><strong>12:20</strong> Scores are level now in netball 3rds!</p>
<p><strong>12:20</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Lacrosse Mixed <strong>17-8</strong> taking four tasty Roses points just in time for lunch. Fantastic game.</p>
<p><strong>12:17</strong> Lancaster score again to make it 16-7 in the lacrosse. Might come out with their pride intact, another opportunity for smug jokes from me lost.</p>
<p><strong>12:16</strong> Lancaster take an early lead in netball 3rds. 5-1!</p>
<p><strong>12:15</strong> York men in the lead for sabre !</p>
<p><strong>12:14</strong> 2-1 to Lancaster in the Womens 3rds Netball. Come onnnn</p>
<p><strong>12:12</strong> Lacrosse: Anna Yeomans scores for York but Lancaster get one past &quot;Big Stop&quot;. 16-6.</p>
<p><strong>12:09</strong> York&#039;s archers are writing off their chances. The shooting takes place over the whole day and at the end of the day the highest scoring archer in each category for each uni. York have brought 5 archers to Lancaster&#039;s 18. According to captain Arjun Kharpal &quot;We&#039;ll have to be extremely lucky to get more than a couple of points today.</p>
<p><strong>12:08</strong> York score again in lacrosse, 15-5.</p>
<p><strong>12:08</strong> Becky doesn&#039;t see quite eye to eye with the referee today.</p>
<p><strong>12:07</strong> Lancaster score again in lacrosse to make it 14-5... York looking baffled apparently. Flat cap guy apparently responsible for a few goals.</p>
<p><strong>12:05</strong> Sabre is making very little sense to Becky right now. They&#039;re doing the same thing yet Lancaster gets the points.</p>
<p><strong>12:04</strong> Eek, another goal for Lancaster, 14-4. More respectable. Worrying that the &quot;wet fish&quot; comment was tempting fate a little.</p>
<p><strong>12:03</strong> Harriet wishes fencing score boxes were electric shock things, for some reason. I say the tips should be electric shock things. Imagine getting zapped everytime you let the opponent score on you? That&#039;s some operant conditioning there for you!</p>
<p><strong>12:03</strong> Lancaster&#039;s mixed lacrosse team pull a goal back, 14-3, but surely only a consolation now - way too late for a comeback.</p>
<p><strong>12:01</strong> Men&#039;s 1st sabre just about to start ! Gear up lads.</p>
<p><strong>11:59</strong> Oh! York win volleyball 15-8 last set ! YAY!</p>
<p> <a href="../../photos/full/4885.jpg"><img src="../../photos/userimage/4885.jpg" width="53" height="64" title="volleyball" alt="volleyball"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>11:59</strong> Burton and Harriet are bonding over Derwent.</p>
<p>Apparently, Derwent international rep Jan, who is also Harriet&#039;s flatmate is on the team and has been promised a mention on <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span>. Hey Jan !</p>
<p><strong>11:58</strong> One of York&#039;s players comes off with a nose bleed, probably saw that flat cap. Another goal takes it to 14-2.</p>
<p><strong>11:58</strong> Ex York student Helen Graham is fencing ex York captain Kat chzhen. Lancaster winning.</p>
<p><strong>11:56</strong> 13-2 and Lancaster&#039;s screaming increases with every goal they concede. Wet fish on dry land, ahaha.</p>
<p><strong>11:55</strong> And in the womens hockey seconds york are 1-0 up already. Hopefully this will end better than the mens hockey thirds who squandered a 2 goal lead to lose 4 - 3 earlier</p>
<p><strong>11:55</strong> Frustrated Lancastrian lacrossers resorting to &quot;lots of screaming and waving of sticks&quot; in an attempt to intimidate but are unsuccessful when York score again to make it 12-2. Unsurprising, considering there&#039;s a guy with a &quot;hilarious white flat cap&quot; playing for Lancaster. Hardly threatening.</p>
<p><strong>11:52</strong> Women&#039;s sabre has just begun! Sabre is the one where you get to proper slash people by the way! Exciting!</p>
<p><strong>11:52</strong> Neck to neck in the last set of volleyball. York 8 Lancaster 6 so far !</p>
<p><strong>11:50</strong> Men&#039;s 2nds team for fencing have just lost 135-106 in the exhibition round. Actual competition starting soon!</p>
<p><strong>11:49</strong> Roseslive.com gives a set score of 4-1 to Lancaster in volleyball. That&#039;s not right, Lancaster!</p>
<p><strong>11:49</strong> 2 more goals for York&#039;s mixed lacrosse team, making it 11-2. Lancaster aren&#039;t in the game at all.</p>
<p><strong>11:47</strong> Volleyball: 3-1 to York so far in the 5th set !</p>
<p><strong>11:46</strong> Sighted: Derwent Chair Holly Burton watching volleyball.</p>
<p><strong>11:45</strong> We&#039;re all getting excited here !</p>
<p><strong>11:44</strong> York takes 4th set volleyball 25-23!! 2-2 now in terms of sets. Last set is the decider!</p>
<p><strong>11:42</strong> Tense play at the volleyball match! 23 all!!!</p>
<p><strong>11:41</strong> Lancaster takes women&#039;s foil 45-36.</p>
<p><strong>11:40</strong> 22-21 to Lancaster in 4th set volleyball. Come on York!</p>
<p><strong>11:40</strong> Goals galore for York lacrosse, 9-2 now.</p>
<p><strong>11:38</strong> York 3rds gutted after losing 4 -3 in the hockey. The captain was last seen entering a nearby wooded area. Whether it was to commit seppuku or relieve himself is unknown at this point</p>
<p><strong>11:37</strong> York&#039;s mixed lacrosse keeper, nicknamed &quot;Big Stop&quot;, has had a great game so far! oh he just let one in. 8-2 to York.</p>
<p><strong>11:34</strong> York continue to capitalise on their dominance in lacrosse, taking the score to 8-1.</p>
<p><strong>11:32</strong> Score is levelled now with another great play from York in volleyball!</p>
<p><strong>11:31</strong> 2 more goals for York&#039;s Mixed Lacrosse team increases their lead to 6-1. They&#039;re dominating the game.</p>
<p><strong>11:31</strong> 4th set Volleyball and its a close 13-11 to Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>11:29</strong> Women foilists gain the lead for now !</p>
<p><strong>11:29</strong> Excellent play from York after time out in 4th set volleyball!</p>
<p><strong>11:27</strong> 11-6 in Volleyball 4th set to Lancaster. Come on York, catch up!</p>
<p><strong>11:26</strong> Lou Highton is doing brilliantly in her first match as women&#039;s fencing captain!</p>
<p><strong>11:26</strong> Hope for York in lacrosse, as a goal for York and a disallowed goal for Lancaster in the mixed lacrosse sees York keep the lead at 4-2 at the first break.</p>
<p><strong>11:25</strong> Fumble by Lancaster gives York more points.</p>
<p><strong>11:24</strong> Well you know what they say, Harriet! When life hands you a good referee one day, it&#039;ll hand you a bad one the next! True story.</p>
<p><strong>11:24</strong> Harriet takes issue with today&#039;s referee, wishes they had hit him earlier.</p>
<p><strong>11:22</strong> Lancaster winning 20-11 in female foil. York are missing their usual foil anchor Kath Gracey. These exams are killing us!</p>
<p><strong>11:21</strong> Fourth set of volleyball doesn&#039;t seem to be going quite so well...</p>
<p><strong>11:17</strong> York win third set volleyball! 25-18 !</p>
<p><strong>11:15</strong> Climbing has been postponed until tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>11:15</strong> Tension is building around the volleyball game as York take their biggest lead! The referee is nearly hit, oh dear.</p>
<p><strong>11:13</strong> Dramatic stuff in the mixed lacrosse. Lancaster equalise but York take the lead less than a minute later, followed shortly by another goal. 3-1 York.</p>
<p><strong>11:13</strong> It seems that play for sailing had already begun last night - our sailing correspondent tells us that she &quot;took one for the team&quot; and successfully inebriated Lancaster (and herself). Surely worth at least half a Roses point...</p>
<p><strong>11:11</strong> Fencing: Captain Lou Highton just finished 7-0 to Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>11:10</strong> Becky lost the first foil set to Lancaster&#039;s Sarah Lamb 5-4. She takes comfort in the fact that last year she lost to her 7-1. Improvement !</p>
<p><strong>11:09</strong> York still in the lead in volleyball!</p>
<p><strong>11:08</strong> York&#039;s mixed Lacrosse team takes a very early lead!! 1-0</p>
<p><strong>11:05</strong> Lancaster have equalised in the hockey mens thirds. Not good.</p>
<p><strong>11:03</strong> Cursing from the Lancaster team. They don&#039;t like this &#039;new&#039; York much. How York won Roses 2010 - a true underdogs story. Wishful thinking.</p>
<p><strong>11:02</strong> Women&#039;s foil is starting, with Becky Ellis up first! Good luck Becky!</p>
<p><strong>11:02</strong> York is taking the lead for the third set of volleyball!</p>
<p><strong>10:57</strong> Apparently the pep talk did some good, and by some I mean a little. Second set 16-25 to Lancaster. But it was a tense last few minutes! It&#039;s best out of five sets, this means York has to win the next one!</p>
<p><strong>10:54</strong> Apparently archery could last up to 10 hours. That&#039;s just silly</p>
<p><strong>10:52</strong> York has just called another time out for volleyball. Serious team discussion going on!</p>
<p><strong>10:51</strong> Is this volleyball, or let&#039;s slide around on the floor of the sports hall?</p>
<p><strong>10:45</strong> Both volleyball teams have called a time out. 15 - 8 to Lancaster in the second set!</p>
<p><strong>10:45</strong> Female fencers are starting to warm up. Girls who can handle a sword, tres sexy!</p>
<p><strong>10:41</strong> York is playing a better game in the current volleyball set, but is still trailing Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>10:37</strong> Lancaster an epic fail, says Harriet! Go York !</p>
<p><strong>10:36</strong> Harriet proud of herself. Someone just asked her about rules of volleyball. Yes she is wise.</p>
<p><strong>10:36</strong> Harriet suspects the guy sitting next to her is a reporter as well. A little bit of media rivalry going on?</p>
<p><strong>10:35</strong> No score yet from the archery, last we heard &quot;they are just firing arrows&quot;. hmm.</p>
<p><strong>10:35</strong> First set of volleyball goes to Lancaster 25-15.</p>
<p><strong>10:34</strong> Both teams of fencers from York have arrived!</p>
<p><strong>10:33</strong> Lancaster is dominating the ball in volleyball. Does not look good for York !</p>
<p><strong>10:33</strong> Just got word from Becky Ellis on fencing. Lancaster 45, York 26 for foil exhibition round. This seems to be shaping up to be a replay of yesterday!</p>
<p><strong>10:33</strong> Volleyball: York not on top form this morning. 7-15 to Lancaster so far!</p>
<p><strong>10:33</strong> And Harriet has just given me the downlow on volleyball! York is off to a good start! Oh she just took that back, both sides have players falling over. Party much last night ?</p>
<p><strong>10:33</strong> First update of the morning! York is in the lead for hockey, with the score currently at 3-2 York!</p>
<p><strong>10:32</strong> Competitions currently ongoing are <strong>archery</strong>, <strong>hockey</strong>, <strong>sailing</strong> and <strong>volleyball</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>10:32</strong> Good morning everyone! Niall, Grace and I are very excited to be back in the library, bringing you all the exciting updates of Roses 2010 Day 2! Stay tuned !</p>
