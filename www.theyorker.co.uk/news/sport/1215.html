<ul><li><strong>York 1sts 2</strong>

</li><li><strong>Leeds 2nds 1</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Last Saturday York men&#039;s football 1sts beat Leeds 2nds to clinch the league title and claim their second promotion in as many years.</strong></p>
<p>Goals from Mark Gouland and Tom Wilson midway through the second half saw York win their fifth league game in a row, and make them champions with a game to spare.</p>
<p>With captain Dom O&#039;Shea able to pick from a fully-fit squad, York put out the strongest XI possible in a now familiar 3-5-2 formation. And with what former UYAFC President Simon Oatridge called an &#039;attractive crowd&#039; to support the team on the sidelines, the league was there for the taking.</p>
<p>The game kicked off with neither side able to assert any real dominance. The windy conditions, coupled with the high tempo of the game, meant that both teams struggled to impose themselves on the game.</p>
<p>On 10 minutes a successful tackle by York defender Evans on the Leeds striker saw the ball roll kindly into the path of another Leeds player, but goalkeeper Emmerson stretched acrobatically to tip the shot round the post.</p>
<p>A brief spell of Leeds pressure followed, but the threat of York&#039;s attack was ever-present. A swift counter-attack from a Leeds corner found Gouland just outside the penalty area, but his shot was fired straight at the keeper.</p>
<p>The majority of the first half saw the defences on top, with both teams aware of what was at stake, and an aggressive midfield battle ensuring that every ball was fiercely fought for. York midfielder Matt Witherwick in particular was a constant thorn in Leeds&#039; side, tirelessly harrying and out-muscling the opposition.</p>
<p>On 40 minutes, a run by Smith along the edge of the Leeds box drew a foul from one of the defenders, winning York a dangerous free-kick just outside the penalty area. Wilson stepped up, but his shot was caught comfortably by the keeper.</p>
<p>With two minutes to go before half-time, Leeds had the greatest opportunity of the match so far. A through ball found the Leeds striker through on goal, but whilst it beat the goalkeeper, the ball smacked the bar, and the subsequent ball into the box was headed over.</p>
<p>After an even first half, the teams arrived at half-time with the score level, both knowing that one goal could be enough to win the game and boost their title aspirations.</p>
<p></p>
<div style="float: left; width: 180px; padding: 2px"><a href="../../photos/full/1236.jpg"><img src="../../photos/medium/1236.jpg" width="180" height="145" title="Football" alt="Football"  /></a><div></div></div>
<p> Within four minutes of the second half, O&#039;Shea was given licence to run at the Leeds defence. Whilst his shot was snuffed out by a crowd of Leeds players, the ball fell to Gouland, who hit a sweet volley towards goal. His shot, however, was also deflected and was easily caught by the Leeds goalkeeper.</p>
<p>On 56 minutes, desperate last-ditch defending was required again by Leeds to prevent York from taking the lead. A run and cross by Cooper on the left found O&#039;Shea on the edge of the area, but his shot was parried by the goalkeeper. With the ball falling fortuitously back to him however, the York captain played it into the path of the onrushing Smith, but his shot was blocked by a Leeds defender. And although the ball fell once again to O&#039;Shea, his second shot on goal was again parried away by the Leeds goalie, this time to safety.</p>
<p>At this point in the game, York were dominating proceedings, and camped in the opposition&#039;s half. And this period of sustained pressure eventually paid off, as York soon took the lead they deserved. A free-kick from the left by McWilliams on 67 minutes was headed into the back of the net by Gouland, much to the joy of the supporting crowd.</p>
<p>Just four minutes later, another York set-piece doubled their lead, although in slightly more fortuitous circumstances. A free-kick from Wilson was lofted into the box, and with the keeper struggling to track the flight of the ball in the windy conditions, the ball went straight into the goal. Wilson unsurprisingly took the acclaim, but the winds of fortune played their part in a goal reminiscent of Ronaldinho&#039;s cross-or-shot goal against England in 2002.</p>
<p>With their side two-nil up and looking comfortable, the banter of the crowd began to increase, with UYAFC President Alex Richards leading the cries, much to the annoyance of the Leeds players.</p>
<p>However, on 78 minutes, Leeds pulled a goal back. A ball straight through the middle cut the York defence clean apart, and the Leeds striker clamly lifted the ball over the goalkeeper to halve the deficit and restore Leeds&#039; belief.</p>
<p>Two substitutions in quick succession by York saw Gardner replace Ramsden, and Murrills come on for goalscorer Wilson.
And within minutes of coming on, Murrills had a golden opportunity to put the game beyond Leeds and seal the win. A ball by Gouland found Murrills just inside the penalty area, and whilst he showed great skill and composure in controlling the ball, he failed to score from just in front of the goal.</p>
<p>Just one minute later, Leeds had an even better opportunity to equalise. On 83 minutes, one of the Leeds strikers found himself through on goal down the left, and when Emmerson ran out his goal to confront him, he rolled the ball calmly across the box for his strike partner to roll into an empty net. But whilst the York players and crowd waited expectantly for the ball to nestle cruelly in the back of the net, the Leeds player somehow construed to roll the ball wide of the gaping goal, much to the delight - and shock - of York.</p>

<br /><span class="author">Captain Dom O&#039;Shea</span>
</div></blockquote><p>York managed to keep their lead till the final whistle to clinch the title and win back-to-back promotions, cuing wild celebrations from players and fans alike.</p>
<p>Asked for his reaction to the title-clinching victory after the match, captain O&#039;Shea said: &quot;I don&rsquo;t know where to start really! It&rsquo;s just been a long week, because we postponed the game [on Wednesday] because of the pitch. But in retrospect it was definitely a good decision, because we got to play on the first team pitch, and I think it showed because all the boys were a lot more confident.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We came out in the second half at 0-0 and just played some really good stuff, and we deserved what we got. I was a bit scared at the end &ndash; kind of shitting my pants a bit! &ndash; because a couple of times we&rsquo;ve gone two up, and then let it go away, but not this time. I&rsquo;m just really proud of everyone.&quot;</p>
<p>UYAFC President Alex Richards seconded O&#039;Shea in his praise of the team: &quot;Absolutely fantastic result. I&rsquo;m absolutely made up for the lads, who deserved it. On the day, they were the much better side, and they&rsquo;ve just been superb all season. There were doubters at the beginning of the season, so it just makes it all the more sweeter.&quot;</p>
<p>Regarding the men&#039;s football 1sts back-to-back promotions, Richards remarked: &quot;Absolutely great stuff. Obviously, it was a fantastic achievement last year, and then to do it again this time around is pretty unbelievable to be honest. So yeah, it&rsquo;s going to be a good evening!&quot;</p>
<p>AU President Jo Carter, who had come down to cheer on the team from the sidelines, gave her thoughts on the match: &quot;Great game, good result, and roll on the knockouts!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>York 1st XI (3-5-2):</strong> Emmerson, Evans, McWilliams, Rixon, Smith, Cooper, Witherwick, Ramsden (Gardner 80), Wilson (Murrills 82), O&#039;Shea, Gouland.</p>
<p><strong>Goals:</strong> Gouland 67, Wilson 71</p>
<p><strong>Man of the Match:</strong> Matt Witherwick</p>
