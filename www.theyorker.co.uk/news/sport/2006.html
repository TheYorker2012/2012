        <p><strong>On Saturday of week 7 the first ever college lacrosse tournament was held on 22 Acres and Vanbrugh ran out winners.</strong></p>
<p>The day began with an air of unpredictability as this was the first lacrosse tournament in college sport history. Despite the lack of a precedent it was Halifax and Derwent who began as favourites due to their host of university players. The randomly selected groups threw up an interesting draw with Goodricke, Vanbrugh, Derwent and Alcuin doing battle in Pool 1 and Halifax, James, Langwith and Wentworth doing battle in Pool 2. Wentworth were unable to field a team leaving the door to the semi-finals gaping for the others in their pool.</p>
<p>The rules were simple: top 2 qualify for the semifinals, the third &amp; fourth placed teams would face play-offs with goal difference counting. Halves of 24 minutes were to be played with a maximum of two male and two female university players in a team of eight players with no more than four men in total.</p>


<h3> Pool 1 </h3>

<p>The opening fixture saw big names Derwent against Alcuin who were celebrating their 40th birthday. Despite playing the game a man down due to the fact they only had 3 girls Alcuin held their own against pre-tournament favourites Derwent with their two university men&rsquo;s team players showing some sharp skills on the break. However, Derwent eventually broke through to take the lead, before a quick Alcuin breakaway saw them equalise. Ultimately a late Derwent goal, something that was to become standard for the day, saw them snatch a 2-1 win to draw first blood.</p>
<p>Vanbrugh and Goodricke locked horns in the second match and almost immediately Vanbrugh led. Goodricke quickly replied before Croker reestablished the lead with his second of the game. Goodricke responded once more before an exchange of goals from university first teamers Whittingham and Ramsbottom levelled the match at 3 a-piece. However from 3-3 it soon became clear that Ramsbottom would be deadly on the break for Goodricke as he led the Goodricke attack to a further 3 goals to finish the match 6-3 winners and top the pool table.</p>
<p>After their stylish dismissal of Vanbrugh in the first game Goodricke cruised to a win against a hard working Alcuin outfit in the second pool match. Despite some often maverick heroics from the Alcuin keeper the freshness and all round sporting ability of Goodricke showed through as they rotated their team to good effect. Alcuin tired and their resistance lessened as Ramsbottom and Waite provided excellent options for Goodricke upfront whilst Kennedy was solid in goal. Goodricke guaranteed themselves a semi-final spot with victory.</p>
<p>After early results Derwent versus Vanbrugh became the crunch match to see who would be likely to join Goodricke in the semifinals. Early domination of play from Vanbrugh meant they went into half time 2 goals in the lead. A solid start to the second half saw Vanbrugh sitting comfortably with 20 minutes gone, however Derwent surpassed their previous late finish against Alcuin with Mike Leahy scoring the second of 2 goals in the final 2 minutes as the match ended in a hard-fought draw.</p>
<p>Due to Wentworth&#039;s absence the final 2 pool 1 games could be played simultaneously &ndash; an intriguing situation given the relevance of goal difference in the results. The situation was clear &ndash; a Derwent win or draw would take them through, a loss coupled with a Vanbrugh win would leave it down to goal difference with either able to progress. The early signs were excellent for Vanbrugh as they ran the Alcuin side ragged scoring seemingly at will before a couple of late goals saw them lead 5-2 at half time. The mood of the green and whites was bettered as the news came across that Goodricke had started to steamroller Derwent, storming into a 5-0 lead.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>Despite the whole Vanbrugh squad, led by goal machine Whittingham, banging goals at will to defeat Alcuin 9-2 the tide was turning in the other pool game as Derwent once again showed their second half strength to come back against Goodricke notching goals without reply, Nick Harris leading the charge with a textbook goal for Derwent. Despite their valiant efforts they ran out of time as Goodricke held out for a 5-4 win to top the group as Vanbrugh claimed second spot ahead of Derwent on goal difference by four goals. Derwent were left wondering what could have been if they&#039;d managed to perform in the first half of each game.</p>

<h3> Semi-finals </h3>

<p>The first semi-final saw an unbeaten James side against take on Vanbrugh. The early quality of both sides showed with both teams working hard to deny each other space and crowd out the attacks on goals. After a couple of early exchanges Vanbrugh scored to take a 2-1 lead into half time. Indeed it was Vanbrugh&#039;s strength in depth of their male players, both university players and not, that saw them work James hard in the second half to record a deserved but perhaps flattering 5-2 win.</p>
<p>After the defeat of the pool 2 winners by the pool 1 runners up there was expectancy in the air for Goodricke to follow up their handball win the previous weekend by making the final again. However their task was made harder by the loss of university team star Ramsbottom who had led them through the group stages who despite the valient and skillful efforts of Waite was sadly missed. Indeed it was Jack Wakefield and Harry &#039;Potter&#039; Collins, the university stars of Halifax, that dominated the match leading them to a comfortable 5-2 victory to set up a fascinating final; pre-tournament favourites Halifax against the free scoring but inexperienced Vanbrugh.</p>


<h3> Final </h3>

<p>Despite not holding sway in terms of experience it was Vanbrugh&#039;s enthusiasm, speed and teamwork that saw of Halifax in the final. With Beale and Hampshire providing a defensive blockout on the Halifax forwards the Vanbrugh midfield and frontline ran riot with Menon, Whittingham and Greetham providing excellent movement and skills in the Halifax half. Despite some early saves of note the Halifax keeper could do nothing to stop the Vanbrugh goals pouring in after Croker opened the scoring with Vanbrugh opening up a six goal lead. Both sides rotated players as the seconds ticked down with Vanbrugh fielding a complete non-uni side at one stage and as the final whistle blew the green and white had defeated their blue and white counterparts 6-2.</p>
<p>Vanbrugh&#039;s success, despite their poor start, was pinned on a solid defence with a hardworking midfield and attack who gelled with a common understanding. The outfield girls worked hard with Greetham and Rebecca providing excellent attacking options whilst the midfield was dominated by the likes of Menon, Crosby, Taylor and Croker. Upfront Josh Whittingham had a standout day as the tournament&rsquo;s top scorer leading Vanbrugh&#039;s attacking threat. Fresher Kate Taylor provided important saves throughout the day.</p>

<p>After what was a wholly successful day congratulations must be passed to Kennedy and Waterson (AU Vice President and Lacrosse President respectively) for their organisation of the day as well as the University of York Lacrosse Club for their willingness to train and referee their inexperienced colleagues.</p>

<p>haha since when were derwent favourites?? There were 3 uni players, same as most other colleges if not less.  Goodricke and halifax were favourites with james and vanbrugh coming in next.  Trust a vanbrugh player to big themselves up.  But well played though, you were the best on the day.</p>

<p>I based the idea that they were favourites on the chat of Mike Leahy who&#039;s own words before the tournament were that if Derwent and Halifax sorted themselves out they should win it and in listing their numerous uni players...</p>
<p>With more than one girl not at Bluefest and who could have played, they had the potential for more there. Also having a proper female lacrosse keeper, allowing more guys also out on pitch, should be a big help...</p>
<p>I admit there is a vanbrugh bias to the article but as I was playing it was difficult to get around all the games and take them in properly and I thought it better to have a write up than none.</p>

<p>Hopefully next year, with more time to prepare, the girls team will be available which will really shake up this year&#039;s results. Vanbrugh were by far the best team on the day, but I&#039;d wager money on Halifax next year if the girls are there...</p>
