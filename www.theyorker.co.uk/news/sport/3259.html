		</div>
		<div class="SubText">In the first of the big first team clashes in this years College Cup it was Vanbrugh who came out on top in what proved to be a feisty encounter. A brace from Ali Prince helped Vanbrugh claw back from 1-0 down to remain in the hunt for silverware. </div>

        <p>Derwent started the brighter of the two sides as Vanbrugh continued their sluggishness that had left them on the brink of an early exit from the cup. Hesitant goalkeeping from Paul Taylor nearly gifted the first goal away but there was nothing the Vanbrugh &lsquo;keeper could do to prevent Derwent breaking the deadlock. Anton Murphy, the self-professed hip-hopper, was slid in on the right-hand side of the box and clinically dispatched the opportunity across goal and into the far post. Vanbrugh were on the ropes early.</p>
<p>Derwent looked comfortable with Nav Jabarkhyl and Matt Hallam playing as orthodox centre midfielders whilst Chris Barnett played off the lone striker Murphy. But it was the irritable Murphy who was the talking point again, but this time for all the wrong reasons. Having been caught by a cynical foul by Vanbrugh skipper Tom Sheldrick, Murphy proceeded to aggressively mount his attacker. The referee booked both players and the confrontation only added more spice to what was starting to boil up into a heated affair.</p>
<p>Vanbrugh looked like they were still in bed, but they finally awoke when Ali Prince turned in the loose ball from a corner. In the absence of Mark &lsquo;Goals&rsquo; Gouland many thought that Vanbrugh would be unable to penetrate the Derwent defence that had yet to concede a goal. But Prince&rsquo;s goal breathed life into a Vanbrugh side that was suffocating under the speed and tenacity of tournament favourites Derwent.</p>
<p>The second half saw an invigorated Vanbrugh side nearly find themselves back to square 1 when hesitation from Dan Hewitt allowed Derwent a site of goal, only for Paul Taylor to palm away well to his right. Vanbrugh may fall short in creativity and panache but they ploughed on in the spirit that saw them crowned college champions this year. And it soon paid off. A free kick awarded just outside the box gave Ali Prince the chance to again show why he should be a regular starter in the 1sts, and so he did. His low curling shot round the wall was well placed but Derwent &lsquo;keeper Ed Amoruso might have done better in keeping it out.</p>
<p>At 2-1 Vanbrugh would only be eliminated if Goodricke seconds could put seven past Langwith seconds without reply. But now they had to hold on and make sure they didn&rsquo;t concede. A Paul Ward-Jones drive rattled Vanbrugh&rsquo;s crossbar and Greg Gardner came close to being the heartbreaker that he so often is, his low drive was blocked by the swarm of green shirts that were so desperate to hold on. Tristan Buckley almost sealed the result with a well guided header that crept wide but 2-1 proved enough for Vanbrugh to progress.</p>
<p>This result meant that Goodricke seconds were up against it and despite their best efforts, they could only win by a single goal. In one of the more ridiculous matches the world has seen, Goodricke hit the woodwork four times before a wonder strike from Matt Cullen gave Langwith an undeserved lead. Despite leading, Langwith never really looked capable of winning and goals from Dave Coupland and the most clinical striker in College Cup history, Michael Sneddon (two goals in 30 minutes, facts do not lie) gave Goodricke the win.</p>
<p>Group One had a blockbuster finish to it with the game between Alcuin and Halifax second teams being decided with the last kick (or head) of the game. Halifax needed only a draw to progress with Alcuin needing the win. Hugh Price seemed to put the game to bed early on with a quickfire double giving the Fax a two goal lead but Alcuin had other ideas.</p>
<p>A smash and grab job from a corner gave defender Simon Reiss the chance to smash home and a delicate lob from captain Thomas Gibby put Alcuin on level terms going into the hour mark which normally represents the finish of the game. Referee Chris Grayland however took it upon himself to give Alcuin the best chance possible by playing an additional 12 minutes, although in fairness it was because the previous game had overran. In the last of these 12 minutes, an Alcuin corner led to an all outb assault on the Fax penalty area with the keeper joining the attack. Everything was in place for drama and that is exactly what the fans got as the otherwise absent Udy Onwudike headed home to spark delirious scenes and a length of the pitch goal celebration culminating in a bundle in the opposite goal mouth.</p>
<p>Goodricke firsts had already booked their progression and looked as if they had already booked and started their holidays aswell in a sloppy win over Langwith firsts. Adam Lewis scored his first ever college goal but sadly for the Goodricke defender it was an own goal worthy of any of the trilogy of Nick Hancock football blooper VHS&rsquo;s. Coupland then levelled with a fantastic individual effort consisting of a touch and a finish before the unthinkable happened and Langwith again took the lead when Tom Parker bundled home.</p>
<p>Goodricke ensured that reality returned to normality by picking up the win with Ronan Joyce and Dom O&rsquo;Shea adding to their goal tally for the tournament.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest shock of the week came as the previously impressive Vanbrugh seconds lost to Wentworth seconds. Wenty were good value for their win and set up an all Wentworth Plate quarter-final with goals coming from Russ Kitson, Samik Datta and Chris Milne. Vanbrugh had earlier scored through Tom Spring.</p>
<p>The first team clash in that group saw Alcuin top the group after disposing of James 3-1. Joe Cooper and Paris Williams gave Alcuin a nice cushion before Matt Smith scored to make Alcuin bums slightly more squeaky. Dan Hyde then dried said bums by putting the game beyond doubt near the end.</p>
<p>Wentworth completed perhaps the greatest week in their footballing history by drawing with Halifax firsts in a game they dominated and could easily have won. Connor Brennan latched loosed onto a loose defensive header to give Halifax the lead but this was as good as it got for them. Wentworth threatened in open play as well as the set piece with the tricky Datta looking particularly impressive.</p>
<p>Wentworth knew they had to win to set up any chance of progression in the Cup and their pressure eventually paid dividends as a Luke Fllet long throw was only half cleared before an unmarked Andy Suggitt volleyed home.</p>
<p>Wentworth went three up top in the search for a winner and were camped in the Halifax box for the last 10 minutes as shots were deflected wide, cleared off the line and brilliantly saved. Wentworth deserved to win but will be pleased with the way they played and should be a force in the Plate.</p>
<p>Derwent seconds secured top spot in that group with a hard fought win over James seconds after new campus cult hero Liam Griffin pumped in another ginormous throw in for James Grey to glance in. The goal only received gentle applause compared to the raucous cheers reserved for whenever the ball went out for a Derwent throw.</p>
