        <p><strong>17:30</strong> It&#039;s been a wonderful 3 days here in sunny Lancaster. York may have lost, but <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> had fun anyway. Thanks to Chiifen for persevering through the weekend, to Harriet and Grace for spending hours in the cold, to Becky for running around the whole time, to Aimee and Niall for saving the day, to Leila for multitasking, to Phil  for his engaging text messages, to Mike for being a man of many talents, to Bryony for volunteering and to all our special correspondents. Until next time, Fiona.</p>
<p><strong>17:22</strong> The Lancastrian cheerleaders dropped their flyer. Oops.</p>
<p><strong>17:07</strong> So, after the other blogs have shut down we&#039;re just sat here waiting for some news. Fiona?..... Fiiiioooonnnaaaa?!</p>
<p><strong>16:42</strong> </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/4907.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/4907.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="footb" alt="footb"  /></a><br /></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>16:12</strong> Comment Editor, Harriet, is now back.  And not sure why she has started referring to herself in the third person. Maybe it&#039;s the cold.  It&#039;s actually pretty difficult to type.</p>
<p><strong>16:02</strong> Rugby 1sts - President Rob Grant, is ecstatic, &quot;That was so much better than beating them by a mile.&quot; Meanwhile, Captain Alex Redshaw commented &quot;It was a dam near run in of a thing, but victory is ours none the less.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>16:00</strong> Tennis Men&#039;s 1st - 4 - 1 down. Bugger</p>
<p><strong>16:00</strong> Rugby 1st - York are celebrating with champagne, Lancaster with full frontal nudity (Fiona has set off running towards the pitch with a camera in hand); that is the gulf in class between the two sides.</p>
<p><strong>15:58</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Badminton Womens 1st <strong>8-1</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:57</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Tennis Womens 1st <strong>10-5</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:56</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Climbing Mixed A Team <strong>292-303</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:56</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Climbing Mixed B Team <strong>277-231</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:56</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Climbing Mixed C Team <strong>118-207</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:55</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Table Tennis Mixed 2nds (Open) <strong>3-14</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:55</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Table Tennis Mixed 1st (Open) <strong>7-10</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:54</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Rugby Union Mens 1st <strong>19-17</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:54</strong> Rugby 1st -  Two minutes on the clock. York has a scrum ten yards out. Lancaster get the ball back, but they are still in their own half. York get a penalty, and kick the ball out. GAME OVER! Full time score, 19 17 to the mighty mighty York, making it a clean sweep for the rugby. The squad are well prepared, with a funnel and several bottles of champagne. Its was close but the rugby club have blitzed Roses again.</p>
<p><strong>15:51</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Tennis Mixed <strong>4-2</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:50</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Badminton Mens 1st <strong>6-3</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:49</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Squash Mens 1st <strong>5-0</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:49</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Squash Mens 2nd <strong>1-4</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:48</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Karate Kata &amp; Kumite <strong>5-11</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:48</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_draw.png" alt="Draw" /> <strong>Draw!</strong> Rugby Union Womens <strong>5-5</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:47</strong> Rugby 1st - York keep it safe in the pack, and make teh hard yards one drive at a time. All they have to do is keep the ball!</p>
<p><strong>15:45</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> American Football Mens <strong>6-22</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:44</strong> Rugby 1st -  Three minutes left.  Lancaster get yet another penalty in front of the posts, making it 19 - 17. Exciting if worrying.</p>
<p><strong>15:44</strong> </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/4903.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/4903.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="basketball" alt="basketball"  /></a><br /></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>15:42</strong> Rugby 1st - Lancaster penalty makes it 19 - 14! Tense final minutes, and on the side lines, Emily Scott gets hit by the restart. Lucky, she has survived.</p>
<p><strong>15:42</strong> </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/4904.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/4904.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="karate" alt="karate"  /></a><br /></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>15:40</strong> Rugby 1st - On the 6th attempt York finally get their try though Tom Weir, 17 - 11, and Grant steps up to make it 19 - 11 with a brilliant conversion. This is York to win now.</p>
<p><strong>15:36</strong> Rugby - Rupert Grant and Tom Weir both cross the line but are hauled back for offences in the build up.</p>
<p><strong>15:32</strong> Rugby 1sts - Lancaster score a great try. Ready for some Rugbyish: &quot;Great running rugby peer them cross the whitewash in the left corner, taking it to 12-11. The conversion would have put them ahead but the angle was too wide.&quot; Comprende? 10 minutes left and there&#039;s only one point in it!</p>
<p><strong>15:30</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Basketball Men <strong>49-65</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:28</strong> Rugby 1sts - A York player goes down after a crunching tackle - you could hear the crack from the sidelines! St John&#039;s Ambulance sprint to the scene but he just gets up and carries on!</p>
<p><strong>15:24</strong> Basketball - End of the game and Lancaster win comfortably 65-49. Yorker never managed to over come the deficit in the first quarter and although they played well, they never managed to match Lancaster&#039;s intensity. Now that is all over, Phil can have a nice sit down and deep calming breathe before he hurt himself.</p>
<p><strong>15:22</strong> Rugby 1sts - York are still making all the chances but they really need to finish one of them off to make themselves less vulnerable to counter attack.

<p><strong>15:15</strong> Basketball -  Those pesky Lancaster supporters are still misbehaving.

<p><strong>15:11</strong> Karate - Lancaster just won another fight 12 - 3. This Michael is so angry that he is heading down the Sports Hall himself to sort things out.</p>
<p><strong>15:10</strong> Aaron Lake is playing the best game he has done all year. He is beating down Lancaster&#039;s giants (metaphorically). Lancaster&#039;s supporter wonder why this beast wasn&#039;t brought on earlier. L52 and Y41</p>
<p><strong>15:09</strong> Lancaster lacrosse team score again - 17-6 to us though! Do lacrosse players get naked at half time too?</p>

<p><strong>15:05</strong> Rugby 1sts - York opt to kick a penalty from 40 yards out. It&#039;s very windy and Rob Grant pulls it wide. Always a bit of a long shot says Tom. The half time score is 12-6 and mankini man is downing a bottle of wine in the centre circle.</p>
<p><strong>15:04</strong> Basketball - end of the third quarter and York are doing well but not well enough. Good playing from Johnansson and Aaron Lake over the last few minutes but its still Lancaster comfortably ahead 51 - 37.n It could be all over.</p>
<p><strong>15:02</strong> Rugby 1sts - Lancaster with another penalty which falls well short, and although they pounce on the loose ball, York make sure they are help up over the line. The York defence is so solid.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>14:59</strong> Basketball - Some of Lancaster&#039;s supporters are behaving rather, umm, un-becomingly. Yorkers man on the pitch called them something rather more colorful. Language Philip, language.</p>
<p><strong>14:57</strong> Rugby men&#039;s 1sts - York work an excellent try off a scrum, with scrum half Tim Walker feeding winger Ed Drewett who goes over in the corner. Grant adds the 2 points to take York to 12-6 up.</p>
<p><strong>14:54</strong> Karate -  Time has been called on the last fight. 14 - 10 to Lanc. So that 3 out of 4 fights that Lancaster. It was 4 each on the kata. Looks like York will be going home with some minor bruises.</p>
<p><strong>14:53</strong> Tennis women&#039;s singles - Cat Hanrahan won her first match 6-2 6-1 and Caroline Braun has won 6-2 6-0. York is currently winning 4 other matches while Lancaster are ahead in one match.</p>
<p><strong>14:51</strong> Tom: &quot;Half time at the men&#039;s rugby 1sts usually features a disturbing amount of nudity. But the York protagonist from last year is now on crutches so maybe we&#039;ll be saved this time around...&quot; Wait, there&#039;s nudity (Fiona here), on my way Tom!</p>
<p><strong>14:50</strong> Basketball - Third quarter has started - Dan Baark sunk Yorks first three pointer and then Moran makes a very lucky basket and the plus one afterwards. Lanc 41 York 30.</p>

<p><strong>14:46</strong> Men&#039;s Rugby 1sts - Lancaster hit straight back with another penalty so it&#039;s 6-5 to the hosts. Apparently Fiona Parr&#039;s neck is not broken, but she has some sort of spinal injury and is in the helicopter now.</p>
<p><strong>14:46</strong> The men are fighting now. 5 fighters on each other individually. Best score in 3 minutes. Oh, its like the Roman Colosseum has come to Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>14:44</strong> Basketball - End of the second quarter and Lancaster is on 39 and York is on 24. the home crowd and size difference seems to be propelling Lancaster to victory.</p>
<p><strong>14:42</strong> 3rd fight 4 - 1 to Lanc. Some of the competitors and flexing the martial arts muscles and limbering up for battle.</p>
<p><strong>14:40</strong> Michael Wilkins, <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span> video correspondent, has joined me (Fiona) to liveblog. A man of many talents.</p>

<p><strong>14:40</strong> Men&#039;s lacrosse - some fierce play with York zooming ahead to 13-3</p>
<p><strong>14:39</strong> Basketball - Lancaster&#039;s charge, was halted by Barret, who answered with a fade away! York 16  Lancaster 33</p>
<p><strong>14:39</strong> York&#039;s rugby 1st player Tom Weir with a stunning try after many phases, powering through a gap in the stretched Lancaster defence. Unusually, Rob Grant misses the kick so it&#039;s 5-3 to York.</p>
<p><strong>14:38</strong> Karate - Jo for York. Becky for Lanc. Jo appears to be unhappy from the start, a problem with her thumb according to reports. 2nd Karate kumite fight - 10 - 1 to Lanc.</p>
<p><strong>14:37</strong> </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/4900.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/4900.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Conversion" alt="Conversion"  /></a><br /></div>

<p><strong>14:35</strong> York&#039;s Richard Barker and Nathan win 1st place for the all male rumba but no points were awarded for this dance.</p>
<p><strong>14:35</strong> The rugby women are frustrated that the match  has ended in a draw - they were all over Lancaster. They are confident that Fiona will be ok, apparently she&#039;s quite injury prone having previously strained her cruciate ligament and injured her eye. They say she&#039;s quite a fighter. The men&#039;s 1sts rugby is back on.</p>
<p><strong>14:33</strong> Basket Ball - Lancaster&#039;s captain is loving this game, scored two baskets in a row to cheers from the crowd. York 14 Lancaster 29.</p>

<p><strong>14:29</strong> Karate - This first fight is beginning, The kumite that is. They get 2 minutes and one point for every clean hit. Now its York chance to take revenge for their defeat and vent some aggression.</p>

<p><strong>14:25</strong> York&#039;s rugby ladies are in tears but are trying to brighten the mood with a champagne photo to celebrate keeping the trophy from last year. The match has been abandoned at 5 all.</p>
<p><strong>14:24</strong> Karate - However the refs just disproved that theory. 4 each so far I think. Thats the kata over and kumite is about to start!</p>

<p><strong>14:22</strong> It&#039;s half time at the men&#039;s lacrosse. 9-3 to York.</p>
<p><strong>14:21</strong> Rugby&#039;s Fiona Parr has broken her neck. The air ambulance has arrived and the men&#039;s game has paused to allow access.</p>
<p><strong>14:20</strong> Rugby men&#039;s 1sts - Lancaster get a penalty and despite York crowd&#039;s best efforts with drum polls and megaphone heckling the hosts go 3-0 up. But have they roused the sleeping York beast says Tom.</p>
<p><strong>14:18</strong> The karate is beginning, two girls are hissing while kicking each other. York win the first fight.</p>
<p><strong>14:16</strong> Men&#039;s lacrosse- After a tense play, York score 6-3</p>
<p><strong>14:14</strong> </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/4899.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/4899.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a><br /></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>14:14</strong> Men&#039;s basketball - both York and Lancaster are playing like the entire tournament depended on it game. Dave Nalton scores the first points for York and then Deniz Ekren. The York bench is going wild. It&#039;s 7-5 to Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>14:13</strong> Lacrosse men - Lancaster score but it&#039;s 5-3 to York</p>
<p><strong>14:11</strong> Chiifen is transfixed by ballroom. It&#039;s the final round: all men rumba, although there are some girls competing. A pair of men have fallen over making dips. Some seriously sexy moves going on between the men: splits, carrying each other, butt caressing, you name it!</p>
<p><strong>14:09</strong> Sports editor Becky explains Kata and Kumite: Kata is a judged pattern and kumite is contact clean fighting. You just have to hurt people lightly. Well that&#039;s lovely, I could do that! Fiona here by the way.</p>
<p><strong>14:07</strong> Basketball men have just started. Looks like a good game. Both teams are playing strongly, they might even dunk! Lancaster open with a 3 pointer and Ben Barrett can jump high!</p>
<p><strong>14:06</strong> York&#039;s rugby player Fiona Parr is down with a nasty shoulder injury and she&#039;s not moved for quite a while. St John&#039;s Ambulance are on the scene and the paramedics are on their way. Nasty.</p>
<p><strong>14:04</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Basketball Women <strong>34-49</strong></p>
<p><strong>14:02</strong> American football - 3rd quarter and it&#039;s 14-6 to Lancaster. There&#039;s a break in the play now as the ambulance has disappeared... Maybe they&#039;re sorting out the rugby lads.</p>
<p><strong>14:00</strong> There are quite a few injuries at the rugby breaking up the play which is bad for York who are in the ascendancy right now.</p>
<p><strong>13:59</strong> The ballroom scores have been announced - cha cha won by Lancaster couple, 2nd place to York&#039;s Clare and Nathan, 3rd to York&#039;s Abigail Fenton and Zoey.</p>

<p><strong>13:51</strong> Malkin is sweeping Chiifen off her feet, she can&#039;t get enough of him on the dancefloor! One more rhumba event, then the ballroom results will be announced.</p>
<p><strong>13:50</strong> In women&#039;s tennis doubles, York has won 2 matches and lost one.</p>
<p><strong>13:48</strong> York score their fourth goal. 4 - 2 to York in the lacrosse now.</p>
<p><strong>13:46</strong> York score again in the Lacrosse! 3 - 2 to York!</p>
<p><strong>13:46</strong> York made a bit of a comeback in the Basketball, but Lancaster played better throughout. Lancaster wins 49 - 34.</p>
<p><strong>13:45</strong> Lancaster score again. 2 all in Men&#039;s Lacrosse.</p>
<p><strong>13:44</strong> Lacrosse: great from Lancaster I hate to admit, and they score. 2 - 1 to York</p>
<p><strong>13:44</strong> Back at the rugby game, one of the Lancaster players is threatening to flash the referee - there&#039;s something you don&#039;t get in the men&#039;s game!</p>
<p><strong>13:43</strong> Lacrosse is really a bizarre sport, or so Harriet Evans thinks, they can run behind the goal. York score again. 2 - 0.</p>
<p><strong>13:42</strong> York&#039;s ladies cross the line twice in Rugby but bizarrely neither try is given - both ruled held up completely incorrectly. Finally Captain Emma Hodgson breaks through under the posts and it&#039;s third time lucky with the refereeing decisions. Conversion went wide so it&#039;s 5 - 5 at half time. What a great time to score for York! let&#039;s hope they keep the momentum going after the break</p>
<p><strong>13:39</strong> Moon and Thompson-Glover win Men&#039;s 1sts 8 - 4 in Tennis.</p>
<p><strong>13:38</strong> American Football: Start of the 3rd quarter. 6 - 6. Lancaster ball.</p>
<p><strong>13:38</strong> Luke Malkin was amazing dancing the candyman, he had his partner on the floor, in the air, under him, on him, Woo!</p>
<p><strong>13:37</strong> Men&#039;s Lacrosse: Lancaster almost score but hit the post. York score! 1 - 0 to York!</p>
<p><strong>13:36</strong> But they&#039;ve run out of ketchup at the hot dog stand. Harriet Evans is gutted!</p>
<p><strong>13:35</strong> There&#039;s quite a crowd down by the Lacrosse. Some strange opening ritual and the we&#039;re off!</p>
<p><strong>13:35</strong> Back at the Basketball, the game is into the fourth quarter and Lancaster are still comfortably ahead. 7 minutes left to play. Lancaster 42 - York 23.</p>
<p><strong>13:33</strong> The Lancaster water balloons are out again at the rugby pitches and this time the catapulter in chief is wearing a mankini. Fortunately he is far away from our reporter on the other side of the pitch.</p>
<p><strong>13:31</strong> Back at the Rugby, the men&#039;s 2nds have just broken through again to widen the gap even further. Lancaster are desperate for a consolation score but it doesn&#039;t come and the final score is 43 - 0. Two lovely Roses points for York.</p>
<p><strong>13:29</strong> They&#039;re getting everyone on the dance floor again now. Our reporter ChiiFin is very tempted to join in, but has no partner! Any volunteers?</p>
<p><strong>13:28</strong> End of the third quarter in Basketball. Lancaster are on 36 and York 23. York are catching up but it seems like the drive behind Lancaster has died down now that they&#039;ve won overall.</p>
<p><strong>13:27</strong> Here at the men&#039;s Lacrosse, or as one of the American Football players described it, the lesser American sport, the teams are warming up.</p>
<p><strong>13:26</strong> Finals for beginners jive have begun and 4 York couples have made it through to the top 6!</p>
<p><strong>13:26</strong> In Basketball, York are bringing it back. Lancaster 36 - York 21.</p>
<p><strong>13:25</strong> In rugby the women&#039;s game is in a bit of a stalemate, with neither side finding the cutting edge they need to break the defensive line. Lancaster look more likely though, as they have the pacier backs.</p>
<p><strong>13:24</strong> Top 6 couples from the previous beginners Cha Cha round have taken the floor again to impress the judges for the win.</p>
<p><strong>13:23</strong> In Men&#039;s Tennis Moon and skinny one leading 6 - 2.</p>
<p><strong>13:23</strong> Luke Malkin and his partner take center stage and outshine the others. Oh no they&#039;ve just bumped into another couple, wonder how that&#039;ll affect their scores?</p>
<p><strong>13:22</strong> Advanced Jive now in Ballroom! Luke Malkin back on the floor. Both Vision&#039;s Tom and ChiiFin are getting very much into the mood by now!</p>
<p><strong>13:21</strong> York&#039;s women are on the back foot again in Rugby but defending fantastically and winning back possession after a great scrum on the 5m line.</p>
<p><strong>13:20</strong> 4 minutes left in the third quarter in the women&#039;s basketball and its Lancaster 34 - York 14. Most of the men&#039;s team have made it now. Dave is still shouting.</p>
<p><strong>13:18</strong> In the Rugby, the men&#039;s 2nds get yet another try and there is no way back into it for Lancaster now. 38 - 0</p>
<p><strong>13:18</strong> Women&#039;s Basketball: Kate Smith just tripped up one of the Lancaster players... good tackle! She&#039;s been known for doing that in games.</p>
<p><strong>13:17</strong> Women&#039;s Basketball: Just heard one of the Lancaster referees saying a &#039;foul (on York player) was accidental so it doesn&#039;t count.&#039;</p>
<p><strong>13:16</strong> Watching the dance the Jitterbug is making our reporter ChiiFen very happy.</p>
<p><strong>13:15</strong> York&#039;s women are really pushing for a comeback try in the rugby with a five minute spell in the Lancaster 10, but the defence is too strong and eventually Lancaster get possession back.</p>
<p><strong>13:13</strong>
Men&#039;s 1sts Tennis - Phil Moon is playing men&#039;s doubles with some skinny guy. Moon has greying hair!</p>
<p><strong>13:10</strong> York basketball men&#039;s captain Dane Vishnubala is confident for York as long as no tall guys show up. Moments later, 2 big guys from Lancaster walk in. Could be a tough game.</p>
<p><strong>13:08</strong> Rugby men&#039;s 2nds score again 31-0 to York.</p>
<p><strong>13:08</strong> Rugby women - Lancaster bag a try in the women&#039;s game through their lightening winger but the conversion hits the posts which makes it 5-0.</p>
<p><strong>13:07</strong> Basketball women&#039;s 2nds - 28-9 to Lancaster at the end of the 2nd quarter.</p>
<p><strong>13:04</strong> Rugby 2nds - York start the second half in the best possible way with a 3rd Matt Pollen try which is converted to make it 26-0.</p>
<p><strong>13:01</strong> Tom would like to rant and I quote &quot;The women&#039;s rugby is starting now, which means no one is watching because the 2nds are still playing. And no one will watch the 2nd half because the men&#039;s 1sts will be playing. The rugby is scheduled like this every year and it&#039;s really insulting to the women&#039;s team. They deserve a crowd too!&quot; You tell &#039;em Tom!</p>

<p><strong>12:55</strong> American football - massive drive for a touchdown by York&#039;s Alex Nock. 6-6 in the 2nd quarter.</p>
<p><strong>12:54</strong> Rugby 2nds - York gunning for that 4th try before the break with some great running rugby and fantastic off-loading, but it doesn&#039;t quite come off. Half time score is 19-0 to York.</p>
<p><strong>12:53</strong> Fusion street dancing superstar Chantelle Nyarko has a lot of support from the bench. It&#039;s 22-6 to York basketball girls.</p>
<p><strong>12:52</strong> As Harriet Evans, comment editor, tells me that it is a legal requirement for an ambulance to be at American football matches, someone gets injured. What are the pads for then?</p>
<p><strong>12:51</strong> A friendly mumbo round in ballroom. Chiifen has a view of a girl&#039;s bum, apparently not her cup of tea. Maybe she should let Phil cover it instead. Jokes!</p>
<p><strong>12:51</strong> It has been announced on loud speaker in the sports hall that LANCASTER HAS WON ROSES!!! Noooooooooooooooooooo!! We&#039;ll still liveblog til the very end though.</p>
<p><strong>12:49</strong> According to ex sports editor Tom Fitz Hugh, Mike Callis is promising to single-handedly win Roses for York. Titanic figure though he is, this may be one task too Herculean even for him.</p>
<p><strong>12:46</strong> Rugby 2nds are still firmly in control of their match and Matt Pollen gets himself a marvellous 2nd try to draw further away from Lancaster. James Mortimer&#039;s kick takes it to 19-0 to York.</p>
<p><strong>12:45</strong> Fiona is blogging &#039;All by myseeeelf&#039;. Sad sad times.</p>
<p><strong>12:43</strong> Basketball women finish the first quarter with 17-5 to Lancaster. Lancaster are firmly in charge, and Phil is enjoying watching teams who can actually play basketball.</p>
<p><strong>12:42</strong> Over on the dance floor, Chiifen explains the rules. There are 2 main categories: ballroom and latin. Each category has different dances, each dance has beginners and advanced. Couples are ranked by the adjudicator Liz Hannah. First place gets most points. That clears things up!</p>
<p><strong>12:40</strong> Rugby 3rds will hopefully set the standard for the rest of today&#039;s rugby says Tom.</p>
<p><strong>12:40</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Rugby Union Mens 3rds <strong>34-22</strong></p>
<p><strong>12:38</strong> Over at lacrosse confusion reigns. York keep scoring, no one know the score, and spectators are throwing balls into the net from the crowd line.</p>
<p><strong>12:38</strong> Rubgy 2nds and 3rds are defending their lines and both succeed in regaining possession and kicking to safety</p>
<p><strong>12:35</strong> Tennis mixed 2nds is all over. York lost 0-6, 6-4, 1-6.</p>
<p><strong>12:33</strong> Lancaster basketball women are still in control but York are gaining confidence. It&#039;s 5 minutes left in the first quarter. 7-3 to Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>12:30</strong> York rubgy 3rds have a penalty making it to 31-10 to York.</p>
<p><strong>12:29</strong> Tennis mixed - York 4-1 up on doubles pairs but it looks like we might lose the ongoing 2nds match</p>
<p><strong>12:28</strong> The viennese waltz heat is open to everyone, even spectators! Someone go dance with Chiifen!</p>
<p><strong>12:27</strong> Good offense and defense from Lancaster girls. York are on the back foot as Lancaster moves the ball well against the zone. It&#039;s 4-0 to Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>12:26</strong> York rugby 2nds get another try. Great run by the  winger from the halfway line to go in under the post. That&#039;s 12-0 to York now. Great start.</p>
<p><strong>12:25</strong> Rugby 2nds get a try in the corner and a stunning conversion across the wind. Score is 7-0 to York. The York rugby 3rds are clinging onto their lead and have possession.</p>
<p><strong>12:24</strong> American football is getting going. Lancaster score a touchdown but don&#039;t make the conversion. It&#039;s 6-0 to York.</p>

<p><strong>12:20</strong> Tennis mixed 2nds still going on and it&#039;s 0-6,  6-1, 1-1 at the moment (York-Lancaster). Grace Redhead, see picture below is cold.</p>
<p><strong>12:19</strong> York lacrosse girls are winning but according to sports editor Becky, because it&#039;s an exhibition match no one is keeping score. Shame!</p>
<p><strong>12:18</strong> Business director and basketball know-it-all Phil Mace tells me tgar the Lancastrian women&#039;s basketball team are a league higher than York. Should be a tight game then.</p>
<p><strong>12:17</strong> The ballroom dancing has started with 6 couples taking the floor. Politics editor Chiifen is worried that people are cheering too loudly and muffling the music. Aww bless!</p>
<p><strong>12:13</strong> Rugby 3rds match is hotting up. Lancaster get another try from a tap penalty taking it to 28-17. The tension is racking up but spectators are leaving to watch the 2nds. Crazy scheduling. Also, Fiona is very glad that Tom Fitz Hugh sends such clear messages. Rugbyish is harder than footballish.</p>
<p><strong>12:08</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Volleyball Women <strong>2-3</strong></p>
<p><strong>12:08</strong> It&#039;s all over for the volleyball girls. Lancaster won the 5th set 16-14. Well fought York!</p>
<p><strong>12:07</strong> The ballroom is filling up and Chiifen is getting ready for the show.</p>
<p><strong>12:05</strong> Rugby 3rds into the second half. Lancaster get a try back under the posts after a sustained spell of pressure. It&#039;s 28-10 to York.</p>
<p><strong>12:04</strong> Over on the tennis courts the 6ths lost in a tiebreak. Pretty close call.</p>
<p><strong>12:03</strong> 5th set in the volleyball is very tense. It&#039;s 13-11 to Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>12:02</strong> American football teams are having prep talks and warming up. Who knew Lancaster had an American football team...</p>
<p><strong>11:59</strong> Volleyball women&#039;s 5th set Lancaster in the lead with 9-6. Quite intense.</p>
<p><strong>11:57</strong> Off to basketball now, hopefully the women will actually have a game on their hands instead of the usual easy victory!</p>
<p><strong>11:54</strong> Rugby 3rds - Its half time and Lancaster have got that fecking catapult out again.</p>
<p><strong>11:54</strong> Tennis - Mixed Doubles 1sts Phil Moon and Kathryn Hannahan win! Awesome!</p>
<p><strong>11:53</strong> Apparently the York lacrosse girls are winning but no one knows the score...</p>
<p><strong>11:52</strong> Rugby 3rds - Try scorer Eastwood makes twenty yards with three commando rolls and a cross-field kick puts Manuel Sarmemto in for the third try. Conversion makes it 28-3!</p>
<p><strong>11:51</strong> And the Lancastrians have won the 4th volleyball set 25 - 18. That&#039;s 2 games each to York and Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>11:51</strong> Tennis - Mixed doubles 4ths have won 6-4 6-3. Mixed doubles 5ths won 6-4 6-2.</p>
<p><strong>11:50</strong> Tennis - Mixed doubles 1sts are two sets up with Phil Moon playing well. Lancaster seems to be getting frustrated. Also, according to our reporter on the ground, they&#039;re a bit too chunky for this sport. York Athleticism ftw.</p>
<p><strong>11:49</strong> Volleyball 4th set drawing to a close. It&#039;s 22-17 to Lancaster. Nooooooooooo!</p>
<p><strong>11:44</strong> Rugby 3rds - York score another try thanks to Jack Eastwood but Peters can&#039;t add the extras 21-3. Peters has done well today, I guess we can let him off.</p>
<p><strong>11:43</strong> Rugby 3rds - Lancaster manage to get 3 back off a penalty but York are still very much in charge.</p>
<p><strong>11:42</strong> York score in the Football making it 1-1. Just a friendly match though. But still, yay!</p>
<p><strong>11:40</strong> Politics editor Chiifen feels that the ballroom dancers are rather too chirpy for her. They look fabulous and glittery apparently and are dancing to &#039;I&#039;m walking on sunshine&#039;. Lovely.</p>
<p><strong>11:37</strong> Rugby 3rds - Captain Simon Reed gets York&#039;s first try after catching a delicious box kick from scrumhalf Ben Turner. Peters adds the conversion to make it 16-0. Shame this is only an exhibition, we could have used some points from this! At least Tom gets to watch a good match!</p>
<p><strong>11:37</strong> Lacrosse is just starting. The wet ground should make things rather interesting.</p>
<p><strong>11:36</strong> Lancaster volleyball women have upped their game leading the fourth set 7-1. If York wins this set they win 4 points for York. Come on girls!</p>
<p><strong>11:33</strong> Some drunker revellers supporting the football... Delightful.</p>
<p><strong>11:31</strong> Rugby 3rds - Peters nails another one. 9-0.</p>
<p><strong>11:29</strong> York footballers are wearing pristine white shorts. Way to support the white rose lads!</p>
<p><strong>11:29</strong> Bad news from the ladies volleyball, Lancaster win 3rd set 25-22. York won the first 2 sets so it&#039;s 2-1 to York overall.</p>
<p><strong>11:28</strong> Breaking News - Our intrepid reporter Tom Fitz-Hugh almost takes off the Touch Judge&#039;s head with the ball. Thankfully everyone&#039;s head is still firmly on, although not by much in the Judge&#039;s case.</p>
<p><strong>11:28</strong> Over at &#039;It&#039;s a knock out&#039; teams are made to wade across shallow water and toss rings. There&#039;s an amazing carnival like atmosphere with loud music and an exciting bouncy castle according to Chiifen. Maybe that will sort out your hangover Chiifen!</p>
<p><strong>11:27</strong> According to wet footed Harriet, there&#039;s some fierce playing down at the football as York fight to keep control of the ball and almost score on a short corner. Fiona wishes she spoke &#039;football&#039;.</p>
<p><strong>11:25</strong> Time out during the 3rd set for women&#039;s volleyball. It&#039;s 21-20 to Lancaster. Come on girls!</p>
<p><strong>11:24</strong> The last game of &#039;It&#039;s a knockout&#039; is about to begin. Apparently they&#039;ve assembled a giant assault course on University Drive. Can we have one in York next year?</p>
<p><strong>11:23</strong> Lancaster score the first goal in the football college winners match. It&#039;s not worth any Roses points anyway.</p>
<p><strong>11:23</strong> Rugby 3rds - Niall Walsh made a great run through half of the Lancaster team only to be illegally spear tackled. Still, York have the upper hand and Peters has nailed another penalty to make it 6-0.</p>
<p><strong>11:20</strong> Apparently some Lancastrian cretin has brought an air horn. Glad to see Peters wasn&#039;t put off.</p>
<p><strong>11:20</strong> Comment editor Harriet Evans is out on the football pitches getting wet feet because she has holes in her shoes... You should have worn wellies lovely! Lacrosse and football teams are warming up.</p>
<p><strong>11:19</strong> Rugby 3rds - York are on the way up! Will Peters kicks it in from 20 yards out for the game&#039;s first score. York are up 3-0.</p>
<p><strong>11:16</strong> Rugby 3rds - York almost get the first try after some fantastic interplay between Michael Bloom and fullback Niall Walsh but they are stopped just before the line and Lancaster kick clear.</p>
<p><strong>11:15</strong> 3rd volleyball set not going smoothly. Lancaster are winning 12 - 11 but all is not lost.</p>
<p><strong>11:15</strong> The numbers on the back of the Lancastrian volleyball girls are peeling off. Could be disastrous. Score is 25-12 to York.</p>
<p><strong>11:14</strong> Rugby 3rds game just starting now. It&#039;s an exhibition match but a lot of supporters are out. A Lancastrian is wearing some giant rabbit ears and another is dressed in full cavalier regalia. How barbaric these people are!</p>
<p><strong>11:12</strong> Sports editor Becky is amused by the volleyball referees hand signals... And the 3rd set has started with 4 all.</p>
<p><strong>11:07</strong> Politics editor Chiifen is hunting for the croquet. No sign of any vice chancellors yet...</p>
<p><strong>11:05</strong> The numbers on the back of the Lancastrian volleyball girls are peeling off. Could be disastrous. Score is 25-12 to York. That&#039;s 2 sets to us!</p>
<p><strong>11:03</strong> </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/4895.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/4895.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="waterpolo boys lanc" alt="waterpolo boys lanc"  /></a><br />Lancaster Swimming and Waterp</div>
<p></p>
<p><span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> girls met the Lancaster waterpolo team last night, too much of them in fact (the word that rhymes with &#039;menis&#039; comes to mind).&quot;Boundaries&quot; is definitely not in their vocabulary!</p>
<p><strong>10:53</strong> Ex sports editor Tom Fitz-Hugh has abandoned fashion in the name of sport. He&#039;s donning a not so sexy anorak down on the rugby pitch. That&#039;s what I call dedication!</p>
<p><strong>10:51</strong> The 2nd volleyball game has started and York take an early lead 10 - 4.</p>
<p><strong>10:43</strong> End of 1st women&#039;s volleyball game with York girls winning 25-16. Woop.</p>
<p><strong>10:39</strong> Exciting volleyball match apparently. York and Lancaster girls are tight with score at 17 14 to York. In other news, Nouse is watching our liveblog. Hi guys!</p>
<p><strong>10:35</strong> You&#039;ve probably guessed it already, but York is not going to win this year... Check out sport fanatic Tom Fitz Hugh&#039;s article: http://www.theyorker.co.uk/news/sport/4673</p>
<p><strong>10:32</strong> York volleyball girls keeping the Lancastrians on their toes with the volleyball first set 9-8 to York.</p>
<p><strong>10:28</strong> Volleyball women off to a good start with York scoring the first 3 points. Apparently volleyball girls like to shriek.</p>
<p><strong>10:25</strong> Ballroom dancing has been moved to 12pm apparently. Politics editor Chiifen can now get over her hangover in peace.</p>
<p><strong>10:16</strong> Sports editor Becky is watching the volleyball girls warm up. She wishes they were wearing swimsuits.. oy oy!</p>
<p><strong>10:14</strong> Apparently some Yorker correspondents spent the night with the football team... oof! Fiona stayed with her granny and had a cooked breakfast. Fabulous.</p>
<p><strong>10:12</strong> Good morning everyone! <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> team is ready to go for the final day in Roses. Bright and early...</p>
