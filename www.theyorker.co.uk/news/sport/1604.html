		<div class="SubText">After a stunning start to the week, your resident experts are back with more money spinning analysis. Today we have the Royal &amp; Sunalliance, the Champion Chase and a Grade 1 Novices&#039; Hurdle. </div>

        

<h3> 2.00 Ballymore Properties Novices&#039; Hurdle </h3>

<p><strong>GTT:</strong> This is a wide open affair, and at least two budding reputations are going to be put to the sword. After yesterday&rsquo;s opening Novices&rsquo; Hurdle however, it looks like we should not get too heavily involved here. The principals in the betting all look too short to be worth following in such a competitive race, so it might be worth taking a punt on an outsider.</p>
<p>Lightening Strike has shown form as good as anyone else here, and showed his return to form with an encouraging run under a penalty last time out. Yesterday showed that it takes a horse with real stamina to win at this festival, especially if the wind and rain are set to stay. The selection has shown he has the guts and loves the conditions, so is worth an each way nibble.</p>
<p>Whatuthink is another with useful form in the book, but doubts about the distance and his attitude mean we can pass over him today.</p>

<ul><li>1 pt <strong>Lightening Strike</strong> to win (55 on Betfair)

</li><li>1 pt <strong>Lightening Strike</strong> to place (11 on Betfair)
</li></ul>


<h3> 2.35 Royal &amp; Sunalliance Chase </h3>

<p></p>
<div style="float: left; width: 180px; padding: 2px"><a href="../../photos/full/683.jpg"><img src="../../photos/medium/683.jpg" width="180" height="145" title="George Taylor" alt="George Taylor"  /></a><div>GTT has some massive priced selections today</div></div>
<p>
<strong>GTT:</strong> <strong>Joe Lively</strong> is an enigma. An Enigma who poses a tricky question. Should a horse be treated so harshly for one flat run? Trained by Tizzard, he was favourite for this on the morning of February the 16th, but by lunchtime he was available at 16s. The excuses were weak, and there is a sense of disappointment in the camp. However, I suggest that we shouldn&rsquo;t abandon him altogether. If he is at his best, then he should take this. The &lsquo;if&rsquo;, is if he has come on for his last run. If he has then 16/1 could look one of the silliest prices this week, if not, then the joke&rsquo;s on us.</p>
<p>More eye catching though is the 9 year old <strong>Starzaan</strong>. A late convert to chasing, he has notched two from two in impressive style. He has gone on this distance and ground over hurdles, and is expected to show that form here. However, his last two wins were in small fields and this is sure to be far more competitive. If he&rsquo;s there at the finish he could easily nick this one, but there&rsquo;s a reasonable chance he simply won&rsquo;t be able to get involved. This is why I recommend backing him win only, this takes a bit of balls in an event like this, but remember fortune favours the brave. This is Cheltenham, bet like a man!</p>
<p>Tidal Bay would be a very interesting runner if he was to turn up, which is unlikely given yesterday&rsquo;s stunning victory. If you&rsquo;re looking at the longer prices, you could do a lot worse than follow <strong>Bagan</strong>. His form is not completely out of reach of the market leaders and he loves good to soft over a stiff three miles.</p>

<ul><li>2 pts <strong>Starzaan</strong> to win (12.5 on Betfair)

</li><li>0.5 pts <strong>Joe Lively</strong> each way (16.5 and 4 on Betfair)

</li><li>1 pt <strong>Bagan</strong> to place (18 on Betfair)

</li><li>0.5 pts <strong>Bagan</strong> to win (100 on Betfair)
</li></ul>


<h3> 3.15 Champion Chase </h3>

<p><strong>SNEER:</strong> The front four in the market will surely provide the winner in this one.  Voy Por Ustedes has every chance of defeating Master Minded this time around, since his 5 length loss can be made up by the 6lbs he now gains.  As well as that, he is a Cheltenham horse and Master Minded has never run at this testing track.  It looks as though Voy Por Ustedes will have the beating of Master Minded.</p>
<p>However, I believe that the two other leaders in the market will be too good for Alan King&rsquo;s horse.  Voy Por Ustedes was said not to have liked the ground at Newbury (which was good to soft) and with more rain expected prior to Wednesday&rsquo;s races this will be a disadvantage.  Alan King could find no excuses for his horse&rsquo;s loss to Twist Magic in the Tingle Creek and that is very worrying.  King did suggest that Voy Por Ustedes is better at Cheltenham, yet Ruby Walsh seemed sure that Twist Magic would have won last year&rsquo;s Arkle were it not for the infamous penultimate fence.  Fortunately for Walsh, that fence has been altered this year and should not be his downfall this time around.</p>
<p>Despite ground to suit and an altered fence, there is one obstacle that Twist Magic will not be able to overcome and that is the front-running <strong>Tamarinbleu</strong>.  Since the introduction of blinkers Tamarinbleu has been a different horse, winning three of his four races.  Only one of those was over this trip, yet that was his most emphatic.  Nicholls believed the tacky ground allowed the &lsquo;three-miler&rsquo; to beat his horse at Ascot, if that is true then similar conditions will give Tamarinbleu the opportunity to repeat the feat.</p>

<ul><li>3pts <strong>Tamarinbleu</strong> (4/1 on Paddypower.com &ndash; stake returned if 2nd to SP favourite) <em>NAP</em>
</li></ul>


<h3> 4.00 Coral Cup </h3>

<p><strong>SNEER:</strong> The favourite Leg Spinner last won a flat race in October, yet it is unclear how relevant that form will be in deciding today&rsquo;s outcome.  Naiad du Misselot took well to a similar trip (and going) at Haydock, but his 9lbs rise for that victory may take its toll.  County Zen is one horse that appeals for this.  He has been risen 4lbs for a place at Newbury.  Punjabi was 2nd that day which strengthens the form (since he finished 3rd in the Champion Hurdle yesterday).  County Zen&rsquo;s credentials mean that <strong>Song of Songs</strong> cannot be ignored here either.  He was just a length away from County Zen in November and now finds himself 5lbs better off, having won twice since then.</p>
<p><strong>Warne&rsquo;s Way</strong> is an outsider with a great chance of being placed.  He was a length and two lengths away from Lough Derg and The Tother One respectively this season and the slightly shorter trip looks set to suit him.  I would not be surprised if the price for this horse shortens during the day.</p>

<ul><li>2pts <strong>Song of Songs</strong> (9/1 on Paddypower.com &ndash; stake returned if 2nd to SP favourite)

</li><li>1pt <strong>Warne&rsquo;s Way</strong> to be placed (6.6 on Betfair)
</li></ul>


<h3> 4.40 Peter O&#039;Sullevan National Hunt Chase Challenge Cup </h3>

<p><strong>GTT:</strong> This amateur rider&#039;s event is best left alone. But where&#039;s the fun in that? We certainly don&#039;t want to be taking any short prices here, if only because four of the last three winners started longer than 33/1.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#039;s Johnny</strong> was once a useful prospect, and at 19.5 looks well worth backing to put his last outing behind him. If you&#039;re perming a placepot, <strong>Back on Line</strong> looks to have solid place claims.</p>

<ul><li>0.5 pts <strong>Here&#039;s Johnny</strong> each way (19.5 and 5.6 on Betfair)

</li><li>1 pt <strong>Back on Line</strong> to place (3.75 on Betfair)
</li></ul>


<h3> 5.20 Champion Bumper </h3>

<p><strong>SNEER:</strong> Unsurprisingly Willie Mullins has a strong line-up in this one, with four horses in contention.  Apt Approach has the best chance out of them as the horse he beat easily to get here (Grancore Girl), has since gone on to win comfortably at Clonmel.  Big Eared Fran also has good form with a horse that went on to win, but the winning distance wasn&rsquo;t as impressive as Apt Approach&rsquo;s and he has been off the track for 123 days now.  <strong>Corskeagh Royal</strong> appeals, as unlike many of the horses, he has run well a few times, so we do not have to work out if his win could have been a fluke.  Bearing that in mind, I feel sure he will run a big race here.</p>
<p><strong>Cockleshell Road</strong> is a slightly bigger price despite a comfortable win at Fairyhouse in December.  This is probably owing to the fact that that race was on heavy ground.  A bit of form on slower ground may not be such a bad thing though, if the rain continues at Cheltenham throughout Wednesday.  The favourite Zaarito has been very impressive, but even the best of horses needs a bit of luck in running and so it is always worth avoiding short favourites in large inexperienced fields.  Any one of about ten could win this so I would advise looking for horses that are most likely to be thereabouts.</p>

<ul><li>1pt <strong>Corskeagh Royal</strong> to be placed (4.1 on Betfair)

</li><li>1pt <strong>Cockleshell Road</strong> to be placed (6.8 on Betfair)
