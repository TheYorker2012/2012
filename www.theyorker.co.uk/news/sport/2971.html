<p><strong>17:32</strong> In netball, lots of pressure from York, but failing to contest their chances: let&#039;s hope it doesn&#039;t cost them.</p>

<p><strong>14:56</strong> Half time has come around for women&#039;s rugby with a score of 12-10 for Lancaster, as Lancaster ladies streakers take to the field! Two of them bear a red rose sign!</p>

<p><strong>14:47</strong> In women&#039;s 1st Tennis York won one match 6-0, 6-0 and has won doubles as well. It&#039;s quite windy which is affecting play significantly. Men&#039;s 1st are warming up with a delay.</p>
<p><strong>14:44</strong> Lacrosse update: after first a quater 15-0 to York, Lancaster aren&#039;t putting up much of a defence.
<a href="../../photos/full/3323.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3323.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>14:43</strong> Quote from Jack Butcher, of the York Volleyball team: &quot;The game was excellent, the best performance of our season by a long way. From the first point we had the lead, and we never let them get in sight of the game after that. We won in straight sets with a fantastic team spirit, despite half the team being new and people playing out of position. Everyone&#039;s trained really hard and it showed today, it really paid off. The crowd were bloody awesome, they helped the momentum and helped us to keep going.&quot;
Sami, from James, an avid Volleyball fan told <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>: &quot;Chipman floated above the Lancaster defence leaving them looking like mugged whales.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>14:41</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Snooker Mixed</p>

<p><strong>14:34</strong> Women&#039;s 2nd indoor football is now hitting half time with Lancaster still in the lead with 4-0.</p>
<p><strong>14:33</strong> The crowd is revived by some warm up lunging by the netball 2nds. Wow that&#039;s stretchy lycra!</p>
<p><strong>14:32</strong> On the rugby pitch, York are still defending solidly, putting phases together in attack. Still deadlocked play in the loose.</p>
<p><strong>14:31</strong> Squash Women&#039;s 1st: first out of five games won by York</p>

<p><strong>13:36</strong> Former YUSU AU president Tom Moore and former YUSU President Anne-Marie Canning were just here watching the men&#039;s volleyball.

<p><strong>12:49</strong> Beautiful defence of Lancaster short corner for the second time today by James Evans in men&#039;s 2nd hockey.</p>
<p><strong>12:49</strong> Rugby is now hitting half time with a score of 18-3. Although York is dominant they need to keep their heads in the game and not think they&#039;ve already won the game.</p>
<p><strong>12:48</strong> York 2nds on men&#039;s indoor football, leading 1-0.</p>
<p><strong>12:47</strong> York score a stunning try through the pace of Des Pollen. Hirst unsurprisingly misses the conversion from a very wide angle with lots of wind. 18-3 with half-time fast approaching.</p>
<p><strong>12:46</strong> Lancaster has just scored in Men&#039;s 2nds Hockey: 2-1 to York.</p>
<p><strong>12:43</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Indoor Football Men&#039;s 3rds <strong>3-7</strong></p>
<p><strong>12:41</strong> On the rugby pitch, York appears too sloppy from the restart and are under the cosh but resist the pressure. Lancaster didn&#039;t deserve to score a try playing such ugly rugby, reports our correspondant.</p>
<p><strong>12:37</strong> On 22 acre: York penalty left hand slide 10m from the try line. Keep pressure up an from line out on the right go over under the posts through centre Jack Miles. Hirst converts for 13-3.</p>
<p><strong>12:35</strong> Indoor football men&#039;s 3rds update: 7-3 to Lancaster, the game is getting aggressive!</p>
<p><strong>12:34</strong> On 22 acres, our correspondants report that the foam hats are back, someone appears to have brought a pot as a percussionary complement to the chanting: great atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>12:25</strong> Rugby update: York have majority possession and pressuring, keeping it in the Lancaster half. ANother penalty, in front of the posts this time, nailed by winger Hirst. 6-3 for York.</p>
<p><strong>12:23</strong> Indoor football update: 4-1 for Lancaster at half time.</p>
<p><strong>12:22</strong> Lancaster has won by 19 points in saber for Men&#039;s fencing, however there are still eleven fight left.</p>
<p><strong>12:17</strong> Men&#039;s 2nds Hockey score was 2-0 at half time.</p>
<p><strong>12:17</strong> Final scores for Women&#039;s fencing are 40-39 for foil, 45-38 for saber. Men&#039;s foil 45-28, only saber to go.</p>
<p><strong>12:15</strong> In Derwent, our dancesport correspondant reports that the competition ought to be starting soon: only the judges are missing.</p>
<p><strong>12:13</strong> Rugby update: York concede penalty as well and the Lancaster fullback pulls it back to 3-3.</p>
<p><strong>12:13</strong> Updated score in indoor football: 1-1.</p>
<p><strong>12:12</strong> Men&#039;s indoor football 3rds kicked off and 1-0 to york already.</p>
<p><strong>12:12</strong> Lancaster kick off and York (wearing shiny new kits) settle into a rhythmvery quickly. Two good early breaks by winger Tilney pile on the pressure. Hirst kicks a penalty: 3-0 to York.</p>
<p><strong>12:07</strong> Trampolining update, in the intermediate session, York had no contestants: the top three are therefore all from Lancaster: Walker with 43.2, Foster with 42.8, Stoaks with 42.5. One of the Lancaster contestants (Lead) fell and hurt her knee and has therefore opted out.</p>
<p><strong>12:02</strong> From 22 acre, our Rugby correspondant reports that there are high winds again but no rain in sight. In fact, the Lancaster fans are all wearing sombreros! Firts up looks like  Men&#039;s rugby Union  2nd XVs, not the Women&#039;s 1st as billed because there are no female players in sight! Kick-off very soon.</p>
<p><strong>11:56</strong> Tennis scores for Men&#039;s doubles so far 8-0, 8-3, 8-6 respectively.</p>
<p><strong>11:55</strong> Think you know how the Roses weekend is going to turn out? Then enter <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>&#039;s competition <a href="../uninews/2963.html">here</a> and you&#039;ll be in with a chance of winning one of three sets of five student part passes for Tru this Tuesday!</p>
<p><strong>11:52</strong> Men&#039;s hockey update, score is now 2-0, both from short corners.</p>
<p><strong>11:45</strong> Men&#039;s Hockey update: York has scored! 1-0 for York.</p>
<p><strong>11:42</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Rowing Men&#039;s Novice 8</p>
<p><strong>11:37</strong> Men&#039;s 2nd Hockey has started now, followed by our correspondant Hannah &quot;Hockey-lover&quot; McCarthy.</p>
<p><strong>11:36</strong> In Trampolining, the intermediate contestants have hit the half-way mark. The top scores for the novices are 45.1 for Lancaster with Wood, and 43.2 and 41.0 for York with Linderman and Nutter respectively. The intermediate isn&#039;t looking good for York as we have very few contestants. However, only the top three score will count for the final score.

<p><strong>11:31</strong> York appears to be in the lead in Tennis, having the first set in two separate matches.</p>

<p><strong>11:24</strong> Though York has lost 1-0 in Women&#039;s hockey, goalie Claire Kirby is reported to have played a great game.

<p><strong>11:23</strong> In Tennis men&#039;s 2nds, Steve McNichol and George Beaumont are doing well 8-3 in their double.</p>
<p><strong>11:22</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Hockey Women&#039;s 2nds <strong>0-1</strong></p>
<p><strong>11:15</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Rowing Men&#039;s Senior 4</p>
<p><strong>11:11</strong> In fencing, the scores are as follows, 5-3 to York for women, and 35-31 to York for men. There are only two remaining fights for men. Suspense.</p>
<p><strong>11:09</strong> Alright, does anyone know the rules of Trampolining? Our correspondant has handed us a list of scores, which to the un(trampolining)trained eye mean, well, next to nothing.</p>
<p><strong>11:05</strong> Don&#039;t forget that you can also check out our live coverage on our <a href="http://twitter.com/theyorkeruk">Twitter account</a>.</p>
<p><strong>11:03</strong> Apparently the stroke is now awake, and is reported to be eating bananas - rich in potassium (K) - she will probably race in Women&#039;s senior 8s.</p>
<p><strong>10:59</strong> Our rowing correspondant, Antonia Moura reports that Lancaster&#039;s women&#039;s senior 4s&#039; stroke has just collapsed: she appears to have pushed herself too hard. For those who are unfamiliar with Rowing-speak, the stroke is the one who sits at the front of the boat. We&#039;ll keep you posted.</p>
<p><strong>10:54</strong> In other news, after a predictable sandwich-shortage in Your:Shop and Costcutter, your loving Yorker Editor was agreeably surprised to find that Vanbrugh provided an array of breakfast butties, milk glasses and cereals. So if you can&#039;t wait for lunch you know what to do!</p>
<p><strong>10:54</strong> Read <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>&#039;s round-up of events from the first day of the Roses weekend <a href="2978.html">right here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>10:52</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Rowing Men&#039;s Freshers 4</p>
<p><strong>10:52</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Rowing Women&#039;s Freshers 4</p>
<p><strong>10:48</strong> In Rowing, Men&#039;s Freshers 4s are up next although they were meant to come before the women&#039;s seniors, there seems to have been a problem.</p>
<p><strong>10:47</strong> Men&#039;s Fencing: 16-11 for York.
<a href="../../photos/full/3318.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3318.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>10:46</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Rowing Women&#039;s Senior 4</p>
<p><strong>10:45</strong> In Rowing, women&#039;s senior 4s are up next: the Lancaster women are known as the &quot;super fours&quot; so it&#039;s not looking good.</p>
<p><strong>10:44</strong> Our Tennis correspondants are surprised by the numner of matches occuring simultaneously... but York seems to be doing well on court 3 with 8-0 for York!</p>
<p><strong>10:42</strong> In Women&#039;s 2nd Hockey the score is 0-0 at half time, with York pushing in the last half of the first half. In town the womens freshers 4s have won, but this brings no point to the competition.</p>
<p><strong>10:40</strong> Alright folks, here&#039;s an overview of what is going on right now: we have women&#039;s 2nd Hockey, Men&#039;s 2nd Tennis, Fencing and Trampolining as well as Rowing in town. A lot of points up for grabs!</p>
<p><strong>10:39</strong> York have just won the rowing women&#039;s freshers fours. The race wasn&#039;t worth any points but adds another win to our every growing list.</p>
<p><strong>10:25</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Rowing Women&#039;s Novice 4</p>
