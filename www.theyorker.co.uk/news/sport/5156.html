		<div class="SubText">With a two day break from the football leaving Aimee Howarth, Ben McCluskey and James Southern feeling a little lost, they give their thoughts on how the World Cup has gone in South Africa.</div>

        
<ul><li><strong>Best Goal (So Far)</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Aimee Howarth:</strong> <em>Carlos Tevez (Argentina vs. Mexico).</em> 2-0 up against Mexico with only half an hour left, you&rsquo;d expect most teams to take the foot off the pedal and start looking forward to the quarters &ndash; but not Tevez! A stunning shot, turning on the spot, around 25 years from goal and burying it in the far corner can only increase Ancelotti&rsquo;s desire to keep him at the City of Manchester Stadium.</p>
<p><strong>Ben McCluskey:</strong> <em>Keisuke Honda (Japan vs. Denmark).</em> Great World Cup goals live long in the memory... I&#039;ll never forget Michael Owen&#039;s goal against Argentina at France 98. Unfortunately, the Jubulani seems to have robbed us of seeing many spectacular goals in South Africa. But Honda&#039;s free kick against Denmark was superb; it was the sort of set piece that would leave Cristiano Ronaldo in awe. Honda has been one of the best players in South Africa, and will surely be give offers to leave to take his footballing talents away from CSKA Moscow and this World Cup.</p>
<p><strong>James Southern:</strong> <em>Fabio Quagliarella (Italy vs. Slovakia).</em> Quagliarella&rsquo;s chip against Slovakia came at a crucial time, which is always nice, and it was so satisfying to watch it plop perfectly into the score-bag. I could watch it over and over for hours. But I don&rsquo;t.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Player of the Tournament (So Far)</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Aimee:</strong> <em>Richard Kingson (Ghana).</em> Much of the Ghanaian success can be pinned on this man. Despite being 3rd choice at Wigan, Kingson has proved his ability in this World Cup with some fantastic and match-winning saves. He proved Ghana&rsquo;s hero in the Round of 16, stopping the likes of Altidore and Bradley when they looked destined to score, and conceding only from the penalty spot. No doubt his agent will be a busy man come July 3rd.</p>
<p><strong>Ben:</strong> <em>David Villa (Spain).</em> With Fernando Torres off form and struggling with injury, Spain have been reliant on their other world class striker. Villa has delivered, scoring four of Spain&rsquo;s five World Cup goals in a manner which makes the &euro;40 million Barcelona paid to secure his signature look like a steal. El Guaje is surely one of the favourites to win the Golden Boot in South Africa, and I look forward to see how he fares at the Nou Camp.</p>
<p><strong>James:</strong> <em>Mesut &Ouml;zul (Germany).</em> He may look like an overworked kebab shop owner, but Mesut &Ouml;zil has been, in my omniscient view, the best player at South Africa 2010. His movement and skill did for EBJT (England&rsquo;s Brave John Terry) in the knockouts, and he&rsquo;s just so exciting to watch. I fully expect him to make Demichelis look like a very silly man on Saturday. The chances and space he creates for M&uuml;ller, Podolski and Klose could very well get Germany to the final.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Surprise Package</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Aimee:</strong> <em>Ghana.</em> Without much World Cup experience, Ghana weren&rsquo;t expected by many to go very far. The Ghana side of 1966, probably the strongest ever, missed their World Cup chance when the African nations pulled out. Yet coming into this tournament with improved performances in the African Cup of Nations, with their first final appearance since 1992 in the 2010 competition, hopes were high for a strong showing. They faced a very tricky group, with the defensive might of Serbia, the Australian sporting pedigree and German attacking prowess all posing tough questions. But they finished runners-up and looked strong in a 2-1 victory (AET) over the USA in the Round of 16 and are likely to prove tough opposition for Uruguay in the Quarter Finals.</p>
<p><strong>Ben:</strong> <em>Japan.</em> Inspired by Keisuke Honda, whose ability I praised earlier, Japan came agonisingly close to qualifying for the quarter finals for the first time in their history. It took a penalty shoot out to eliminate them in the second round, after a depressingly dull 0-0 draw with Paraguay. At the group stage they defeated Cameroon and Denmark, and made it difficult for the Netherlands to beat them. They can leave South Africa proud of their efforts, and I hope to see more from Honda and company at Brazil 2014.</p>
<p><strong>James:</strong> <em>Chile.</em> Definitely Chile. If that team was a woman, I&rsquo;d marry and have kids with her. Their attitude, tactics and formation have all been so refreshing. That&rsquo;s not what I look for in a woman, but you catch my drift. Even when the Chileans were defending a close 1-0 lead over Switzerland in the second game they were passionately attacking in great number, like something out of Braveheart. It&rsquo;s a shame they went out so easily to Brazil.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Biggest Flops</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Aimee:</strong> <em>Nigeria.</em> You know things are going badly when your president, embarrassed by your showing at the World Cup, bans you from international football for the next two years. This is what has happened to the Nigerian side after they finished bottom of their group. Despite having many big names, such as Yakubu, Kanu, Martins and Yobo, they failed to win a game, leaving Nigerians frustrated at their continued inability to seriously challenge on the world stage.</p>
<p><strong>Ben:</strong> <em>Italy.</em> What a difference four years makes. In 2006, Italy and France made it to the World Cup final. In South Africa, they didn&rsquo;t even make it to the second round. They both flopped, but France looked weak long before the World Cup began, as anyone from the Republic of Ireland will tell you. I&rsquo;m surely no English fan looks fondly on the team&rsquo;s World Cup campaign, least of all their brutal demolition at the hands of Germany, but surely I can&rsquo;t be the only one that almost expected us to self-combust? Italy&rsquo;s poor performance was the biggest shock for me, although given their lethargic performance at the Confederations Cup last year and the fact that their squad was one of the oldest in South Africa, perhaps it should not have surprised me.</p>
<p><strong>James:</strong> <em>England.</em> At least France weren&rsquo;t trying. At least Italy were world champions anyway. There&rsquo;s nothing for England to hide behind. Even taking into account the obnoxious, racist propaganda from The Sun and The Mirror, particularly before the Germany game, there really is no reason why those players play like they do for England. It&rsquo;s a fascinating psychological conundrum AND a pain in the arse, all at the same time.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Likely Winners</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Aimee:</strong> <em>The Netherlands.</em> With many teams looking strong, such as Argentina, Germany and Brazil, the quarter finals are going to be close. However, the Holland squad this time round seem to have what&rsquo;s required to win competitions, with an unerring ability to churn out results. Far from the &lsquo;total football&rsquo; of the late 70s that took them to two finals, their workmanlike approach could be the difference this time to beat their World Cup duck. The true test of this squad will come from a well-organised Brazilian squad, but a win here and the Dutch could never have a better opportunity to take home the World Cup.</p>
<p><strong>Ben:</strong> <em>Brazil.</em> I&rsquo;m betting (not literally, as I don&rsquo;t have the money to) on a Brazil/Argentina final, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to it. Diego Maradona has shaken off the criticism he faced before the tournament by getting his nation firing on all cylinders, and I think Javier Mascherano and company have what it takes to see off Germany and probably Spain. But Dunga&rsquo;s Brazil team reminds me of Jose Mourinho&rsquo;s Chelsea. They&rsquo;re not boring, but they are efficient. Their victory over Chile in the second round was their strongest performance yet, and I expect them to keep up their winning ways against the Netherlands and Uruguay/Ghana.</p>
<p><strong>James:</strong> <em>Brazil.</em> Brazil, without doubt. I really can&rsquo;t see anyone balancing the tasks of getting past Felipe Melo/Gilberto Silva in midfield and the organised defence AND keeping out Robinho and co. at the other end. Spain are the only team with the players to challenge Brazil, but they will fail if they continue to go with two defensive midfielders. This is a pretty boring answer, I should have gone with Ghana or something to be interesting and entertaining, but then I&rsquo;d just be talking out of my vuvuzela.</p>
