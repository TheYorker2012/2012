<p><strong>19:30</strong> Save for the remaining skiing results, that&#039;s it from <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> for today. We&#039;ll see you again bright and early for Ballroom Dancing at 9am tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>19:15</strong> Cricket: They say it isn&#039;t over till Tom Hudson sings: well he will crack out a tune now as a horrid misfield hands him a boundary and York the match.</p>

<p><strong>16:21</strong> American football: scrappy start with Lancaster attacking and making good ground and scoring early. York did nothing with their attack but then got a turnover on Lancaster&#039;s first down and capitalise on a good throw to score their own touchdown. 6-6.</p>
<p><strong>16:16</strong> 4-0 to York in squash, one more point to go.</p>

<p><strong>15:18</strong> The rain and wind are vicious over at 22 acres, cricket has been suspended and it doesn&#039;t look good for ultimate frisbee</p>
<p><strong>15:17</strong> Karate is just getting started. Stay tuned.</p>
<p><strong>15:16</strong> Edgy shot to leg: it looks like this man&#039;s going to struggle. However, a shower brings the players off and the muppet show to a temporary close: it&#039;s 115-9.</p>
<p><strong>15:14</strong> Rugby 7s Men&#039;s 1st is over. 24-10 for York. This gives us an extra 2 points and puts the overall Roses score at 20-11 for York. Tom Bugge was outstanding with 2 tries.</p>

<p><strong>14:37</strong> Kicking not going well for Lancaster, as York dominate rugby. Terraga marks another try under posts, it&#039;s converted. 24-0. One point easily securd for York and a high standard set.</p>

<p><strong>14:28</strong> Rugby 7s men&#039;s 3rd: Try and conversion for York! 12-0</p>
<p><strong>14:27</strong> More from cricket: Emo&#039;s length is still probing round Lancaster&#039;s edges. At eighty for seven, their batsmen are making less impact than Gordon Brown&#039;s fiscal stimulus.</p>
<p><strong>14:25</strong> Rugby Men&#039;s 3rd: York is defending very well and aggressively allowing Lancaster no space. 5-0 to York at half time.</p>
<p><strong>14:24</strong> Update from our Yorker correspondent watching the crickets at 22 acres: &quot;The only thing dropping faster than Lancaster wickets is the temperature. It must be about -4, and the wind looks strong enough to blow emo over. One suspects it would require a force nine to topple Hudson.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>14:22</strong> Women&#039;s rugby 2nds: Lancaster deals the first blow, 5-0 in the first minute.</p>
<p><strong>14:21</strong> Rugby men&#039;s 3rds 7s kick off and Lancaster are on the attack straight away but York defend and break through Pete Terraga 60 yards down the right wing to score uunder the posts. No conversion. York 5-0 up after 2 minutes!</p>
<p><strong>14:17</strong> Tommy Hudson is looking and bowling like Shane Warne before the slinnng pills. It&#039;s a master class in leg spin from the big man.</p>

<p><strong>14:13</strong> Squash: York is winning 3 games to 0.</p>
<p><strong>14:11</strong> Cricket update: Another wicket! Hudson gets a, to say the least, generous decision. With Hudson&#039;s balls at one end and Emo&#039;s length at the other, Lancaster surely can&#039;t take this any longer.</p>
<p><strong>14:08</strong> York has won two of the squash matches. Results coming up soon.</p>
<p><strong>14:05</strong> Emo&#039;s length is still making things hard for Lancaster&#039;s batsmen. And a wicket! with a third LBW, it&#039;s 70-6.</p>
<p><strong>14:03</strong> Random trivia: like every year, Lancaster&#039;s rugby players have bleached their hair. They used to spray paint it red according to the colour of their rose, but it often ran and got in their eyes.</p>
<p><strong>14:01</strong> York hero Tom Hudson comes on. The first openly gay player to represent York, Hudson is an inspiration and role model to many.

<p><strong>13:58</strong> The Lancaster number seven looks shaky: he drives with the confidence of a blind man behind the wheel of a Porsche in an oil slick.</p>
<p><strong>13:54</strong> Wicket: Martin&#039;s length often criticised in the past is working wonders. A full Yorker hits middle half way up. It&#039;s 60 for 5.</p>
<p><strong>13:50</strong> Brilliant bowling from emo: his length is winning admiration from all present.</p>
<p><strong>13:49</strong> Men&#039;s 2nd XV captain Sam Dudley told <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>: &quot;They think they&#039;re here on a jolly in York today, they&#039;re not. They&#039;re here to get a pasteing!&quot;</p>

<p><strong>13:46</strong> Wicket! The skipper takes a smart catch as Martin gets another: 55-3.</p>
<p><strong>13:45</strong> Rugby men&#039;s 3rd 7s update: Sun and rain can&#039;t decide if they&#039;re coming or going, but the wind is out in force so the kicking game will be hampered today. Both sides will want ball in hand down on the ground running at the opposition.</p>
<p><strong>13:40</strong> Martin is on fire, a wicket maiden. Legendary off spinner emo is on, into his wind. Let&#039;s hope his spell is as long and as succesful as his hair.</p>
<p><strong>13:37</strong> Elsewhere in the viewing gallery, spectators are excitedly chatting away while watching Men&#039;s 2nd squash.</p>

<p><strong>11:58</strong> <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> has discovred that a suspicious character has been spotted on campus. He is reported to be wearing black trousers, a fawny coloured jacket and carrying a Sainsbury&#039;s carrier bag.  He has a north east accent. In an email sent to Computer Science and Psychology students, University staff have been asked to ring security if they see him.</p>
<p><strong>11:45</strong> Coming up: Indoor frisbee, cricket and squash.</p>
<p><strong>11:34</strong> Mens 2nds and mixed badminton seem to be finishing up soon. We&#039;ll have scores for you in a bit. Meanwhile, some mindless trivia: did you know the badminton shuttlecock has the highest top speed compared any other racket sport?! Badminton first became an olympic sport in 1992.</p>
