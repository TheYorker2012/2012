<ul><li><strong>York 1sts 1</strong>

</li><li><strong>Bradford 1sts 0</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>As York football&#039;s 1st XI get to the business end of the BUSA season, luck and form seem to be on their side.</strong></p>
<p>Although a 1-0 win at home to Bradford&#039;s 1st team isn&#039;t a blockbusting win, grinding out 3 points against the side bottom of their BUSA division showed character, and once again reinforced how far York have come since earlier in the season.</p>
<p>On previous occasions first half leads were not converted into wins, but rather led to late equalisers or even winners for the opposition, due to a combination of defensive lapses and an inability to kill sides off. However, last Wednesday York held strong to maintain their 3 point lead at the top of the table.</p>
<p>York may have been duped into underestimating their opposition when one of the twelve players stepping off the Bradford team bus seemed to be calming his pre-match nerves with a can of Carlsberg, or two. Likewise, their shabby warm-up routine was overshadowed by the militant-like professionalism of Dom O&#039;Shea&#039;s pre-match routine under the watchful eye of Johnny McWilliams and the team mascot, McWilliams&#039; father! But despite Bradford&#039;s antics, the York players stayed focused on the job at hand, with the disappointing 3-3 draw in the reverse fixture fresh in their mind.</p>
<p>Sticking with the 3-5-2 formation, York took 10 minutes before really getting in the swing of things, but once they did it soon became apparent that they were the better footballing team. A bizarre asymmetrical Bradford formation allowed Henry Smith to frequently get one-on-one with the Bradford full-back down the right hand side, and it was one of Smith&#039;s deep crosses that led to the first clear-cut chance of the match, as Alex Cooper, playing on the opposite wing, charged into the box. Unfortunately his back-post header didn&#039;t connect well and the ball bounced wide when he really should have done better.</p>
<p>Despite more joy down the right hand side for Smith, Wilson, Evans and Witherwick, York couldn&#039;t conjure up the opening goal. It was in fact good pressure from the left that led to Mark Gouland stealing the ball from the sloppy Bradford &#039;keeper, but faced with an opening goal from a tight angle his right-footed cross-come-shot evaded the onrushing O&#039;Shea and went out for a goal kick.</p>
<p>More chaotic defending led to a few volleyed chances for captain O&#039;Shea; one lobbing the keeper, but it agonisingly clipped the bar as it sailed over. The second, a swiveling left-foot volley following a cross from the left, found the welcoming hands of the Bradford goalkeeper.</p>
<p>Despite the one-way traffic, the game turned out to be a two-way street when a good move from Bradford resulted in a close range volley flying inches over the York crossbar.</p>
<p>On the 30 minute mark one of Henry Smith&#039;s trademark forages down the touchline took him inside the full-back, and as two clumsy defenders sandwiched the winger, his legs were taken away from him and the referee pointed at the spot. The protests paled in comparison to those of Leeds TASC&#039;s the previous week when a similar incident led to an on-pitch brawl, but this time Matt &#039;Raging Bull&#039; Witherwick kept his cool, as did Gouland, who struck his penalty confidently but predictably to the goalkeeper&#039;s right, who got a hand to the ball but couldn&#039;t keep it out.</p>
<p>As the teams came off at half-time it was 1-0 to York and fully deserved, though players on both sides knew they had more to give.</p>
<p>The second half was a similar affair, with York on top but the game not quite coming alive, with both teams misplacing passes. But the home side&#039;s defence looked solid and confident in their quest for a second clean sheet in as many games.</p>
<p>With half an hour to go, defender Andy Rixon twisted his knee and was in obvious discomfort as O&#039;Shea pulled him off, much to the displeasure of Rixon&#039;s parents who were watching on the sidelines. Gardner slotted in as a like-for-like substitute in the centre of defence between the experience of Evans and McWilliams, and York continued to hold off Bradford&#039;s attacks.</p>
<p>More chances fell to Wilson and O&#039;Shea among others, but Bradford made up for what they lacked in quality with sheer passion as they flung their bodies in front of numerous goal-bound shots.</p>
<p>As Bradford piled the pressure on, York&#039;s defence held firm and unlike the York of a month or two ago, avoided dropping too deep and inviting Bradford onto them. Fresh legs from Murrils, who replaced Gouland, helped keep Bradford on their toes, plus tireless closing down and the tracking of runners with Germanic efficiency by Ramsden meant chances were few and far between.</p>
<p>A distinct lack of service from the Bradford midfield meant it was an uphill struggle for their lone striker, but one Bradford free kick resulted in McWilliams heading the ball towards his own goal. But whilst he buried his head in his hands Vanbrugh-style the ball flew narrowly over Emmerson&#039;s goal.</p>
<p>McWilliams&#039; failed attempt to steal the own goal crown from Cooper Emmerson was the closest Bradford came and York played out the last 5 minutes in relative comfort, passing the ball around their shattered opponents.</p>
<p>The final whistle brought relief to the scenesters on the sidelines and pitch alike as York showed determination to keep up their title hopes. York should have put the game out of Bradford&#039;s reach early on, but winning the game without playing particularly well will give the squad confidence in their bid for promotion.</p>
<p>Despite Leeds also winning, York are sitting pretty 3 points clear with two games to go. Though with the final two fixtures being against Leeds and Durham it&#039;s certainly not won yet. Other than Rixon&#039;s injury, O&#039;Shea can boast a fit squad in good form, so the Christmas break could be at better time. But nonetheless the players will be looking forward to a relaxing mince pie or two safe in the knowledge that McWilliams and O&#039;Shea will have a rigorous training program in place for their return in January.</p>
<p><strong>York 1st XI (3-5-2):</strong> Emmerson, Evans, McWilliams, Rixon (Gardner 62), Smith, Cooper, Wilson, Witherwick, Ramsden, O&#039;Shea (capt.), Gouland (Murrills 74).</p>
<p><strong>Goals:</strong> Gouland 31 pen.</p>
