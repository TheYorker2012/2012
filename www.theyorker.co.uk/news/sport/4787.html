        <p><strong>Following the disappointing news that the rugby union Men&rsquo;s 1st team missed out on promotion this season we have some excellent news about the Men&rsquo;s 2nds team. They have secured a promotion from league 3b to 2b. I spoke to the charming captain Will Tate to find out what that meant for the team as a whole, and also what it meant to him as a captain. I also found out his opinions on how his team have done this seasons and how they&rsquo;re looking to continue this success in the league above.</strong></p>
<p>I was a bit in the dark on how the league systems work in University Rugby, so Tate informed me that the B is just the area of the country we are in, so we&rsquo;re in the North East division alongside universities such as Sheffield and Durham. Tate told me that it was the number which mattered the most. Once the team get into 1b, they will then be promoted into the Premier league, which, as Tate told me, is where the first team should be now, however they missed out on that due to technicalities. Tate told me that the promotion was a cause for celebration, however the 1st&rsquo;s disappointment still hangs over UYRUFC as a whole, Tate told me that Alexander Redshaw, the 1sts captain, was still cut up about not being promoted and that it was a shame they can&rsquo;t end the year with both teams celebrating together.</p>
<p>Tate said it meant a huge amount to everyone, especially the third years on the team, to be promoted this season. As Tate believes that after all the hard work they put in, the hours of training as a team and individually, they deserved the promotion. He told me that the team had done much better than they usually do and that the solid season was a testament to the work that everyone puts in.</p>
<p>After all this talk of having a solid season, I was hoping to find out exactly what Tate thought that strengths of the team were. Without a breath, Tate told me that the back line were easily the best feature of the team, stating that they could even rival the first team players. But while Tate said he felt it was the back line who won the games for them, he also pushed the forwards a lot too this seasons, working on scrums and line-ups. Tate further stated that it was harder for his front line as they aren&rsquo;t exactly &lsquo;biggest&rsquo; lads in the game, and that because of this they struggle to boss other teams about.</p>
<p>I also asked Tate if there were any individual players he would like to give a special mention to. Although he is proud of all his lads, there were a few individuals who he praised above the others. The first is Matthew Pollen who plays centre. Tate told me that Pollen has been the &lsquo;star man&rsquo; of the season and that he is a fantastic all round sports man. Tate also told me that Pollen is linked well with another of his greatest players, James Mortimer, the fly half. As a massive fan of Mortimer, I have praised him well in my other articles and was glad he got a mention. Tate said that the fact that Mortimer has done so well, coming from what Tate describes as a rough background, is really a testament to Mortimer&rsquo;s character. Also, who can deny Mortimer&rsquo;s skill when it comes to conversions and penalties? His brilliant footwork is that of a professional, some would say a God. But I digress. Tate told me that this year there has been a brilliant fresher intake, players like Sam Morrison, Sam Carr-Archer and Rishi Naidoo, have all worked well and fit in with the team brilliantly.</p>
<p>I tried to pry Tate for some inside gossip, such as who he thought would be filling his shoes as 2nds captain next year? He wasn&rsquo;t giving much away, but said if he had to put money on it, he believed that Matt Pollen could take the crown, that is, if he didn&rsquo;t get snatched up by the first team. I also found out that the new first team captain has already been elected - so congratulations to Tom Weir, and good luck for next season, let&rsquo;s hope you can continue the push for promotion.</p>
<p>Tate also had some praise for some of the thirds team members who he hopes will be joining the 2nds next year, he mentioned names such as Will Peters, Benjamin Turner, and Sam Carr-Archer as hopefuls to push the team to even more victories.</p>
<p>As this is Tate&rsquo;s last year at university, before he goes and rejoins the real world, I asked him if he had any goodbyes, regrets or wishes. Tate told me that he has enjoyed himself greatly for the last three years, and that although he was not in the first team that didn&rsquo;t matter. He was very proud to have led the seconds to this victory and he has had a brilliant time working with them. As for when we&rsquo;ll see the rugby lads out again, Tate told me that week five will be a big going out week for them, so if you see the players, congratulate them, as they&rsquo;ve done brilliantly.</p>
<p>All in all, congratulation to them Rugby Union XV Men&rsquo;s second team and all the best for next year.</p>
<p>Well done 2nds, you&rsquo;ve done us proud.</p>
