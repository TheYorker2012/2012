        <p><strong>22:33</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Pool Men&#039;s</p>
<p><strong>22:09</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Pool Women&#039;s <strong>5-4</strong></p>
<p><strong>22:09</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_yorkshire.html" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Badminton Men&#039;s 1sts <strong>3-6</strong></p>
<p><strong>01:33</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Badminton Women&#039;s 1sts <strong>7-2</strong></p>
<p><strong>20:45</strong> Okay folks, we&#039;re off for some food. Chinese, pizza or fish and chips? Lancaster&#039;s campus catering doesn&#039;t offer much for the health-conscious Yorker sports team. Pool and badminton results will be added when they finish and the blog will carry on tomorrow for the climax of Roses 2008. Don&#039;t miss it!</p>
<p><strong>20:41</strong> That&#039;s it, it&#039;s all over! Our small helping of canoe polo has left us gagging for more, and the York players gagging for air. They really were hammered, but they gave it a good shot. Always next year lads!</p>
<p><strong>20:39</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Canoe Polo Open <strong>4-0</strong></p>
<p><strong>20:37</strong> The Lancaster forwards are giving York&#039;s defence a torrid time in the pool (canoe polo again guys, it&#039;s so much better than badminton!). They&#039;ve hit the post several times but no actual goals.</p>
<p><strong>20:27</strong> 4-0 at half-time in the men&#039;s canoe polo. Still enthralling!</p>
<p><strong>20:22</strong> 2-0 to Lancaster in the men&#039;s canoe polo. The home crowd go wild! <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> team gaze on in amazement at 10 canoes chasing a ball around a swimming pool.</p>
<p><strong>20:19</strong> York take the opening games in the men&#039;s badminton 2-1 2-1 2-0.</p>
<p><strong>20:07</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_yorkshire.html" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Canoe Polo Women&#039;s <strong>1-3</strong></p>
<p><strong>20:06</strong> 101 points for York as women&#039;s canoe polo is all done. Away Roses? Easy.
Men&#039;s canoe polo up next.</p>
<p><strong>20:05</strong> Bizarre hand gestures from the referee in canoe polo leave <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> team bemused, but we&#039;re sure it&#039;s still 3-1 to York.</p>
<p><strong>20:01</strong> A collision in the men&#039;s badminton leaves two York players with broken racquets after they both went to make the same shot. God job they have spares!</p>
<p><strong>19:59</strong> 3 - 1 to York now in canoe polo. This could bring the 100 point mark up for York.</p>
<p><strong>19:57</strong> Half-time in the canoe polo and it&#039;s 2-1 to the York women. It&#039;s frantic stuff and I was sure the Lancaster goalkeeper was about to drown! A sneaky little eskimo roll (If that&#039;s what they&#039;re called?) later and she was good as new, if a little out of breath.</p>
<p><strong>19:56</strong> Jonty Hiley &amp; Rob Walker are making their opposition work so hard in the men&#039;s badminton that one has already changed his shirt after the first game!</p>
<p><strong>19:53</strong> This canoe polo looks like it was created from a competition to invent the world&#039;s most ridiculous game.</p>
<p><strong>19:49</strong> From the pool to pool and it&#039;s mixed fortunes for York as they lead 1-0 in the men&#039;s but are 2-1 down in the women&#039;s. It&#039;s 1-1 in the greatest sport the world has ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>19:48</strong> The women&#039;s canoe polo has started. No score yet but it&#039;s feisty! This is oar-some...</p>
<p><strong>19:44</strong> Lowdown on canoe polo after chatting poolside to one of the York players.</p>
<p>Apparently it&#039;s 5-a-side, 7 minute halves and basically anything goes! The goalkeeper uses his paddle to stop the ball (standard water polo ball) going in the net that is hoisted 2 metres above the pool. All sounds very confusing but we&#039;ll do our best to bring you in-depth analysis!</p>
<p><strong>19:35</strong> The York mens badminton team have just unveiled their pink &#039;The A Team&#039; t-shirts! Excellent!</p>
<p><strong>19:31</strong> This is genuinely mental, there&#039;s a goal suspended in mid air and we&#039;re not really sure what&#039;s going on. Young Greg has gone to check on the rules.</p>
<p><strong>19:27</strong> Soon to be Yorker reporter Henry Smith is strolling around in a Yorker cap. That&#039;s jumping the gun a bit Henry. Football guys are off for a team meal before tomorrow&#039;s matches but fingers crossed York will already have been victorious by then!</p>
<p><strong>19:24</strong> Next up in the sports centre is the badminton, can&#039;t wait to see what Lancaster&#039;s reaction is to the men&#039;s Roses strip.</p>
<p><strong>19:23</strong> A late goal from Benjamin Smith couldn&#039;t save the water polo guys as they go down 13 - 9.</p>
<p><strong>19:23</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Waterpolo Men&#039;s <strong>13-9</strong></p>
<p><strong>19:17</strong> Apparently next up in the pool is water polo with canoes. Are my ears deceiving me? This sounds like the greatest sport in the world. Who on earth came up with it? Whoever it is, I love them.</p>
<p><strong>19:13</strong> Instead of looking at the boys speedos our correspondent was looking at their hats. You can&#039;t blame him really.</p>
<p><strong>19:12</strong> Confusion at the water polo, 11-6 to Lancaster instead of York winning. Its anything but goals, goals and goals for York.</p>
<p><strong>19:10</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_yorkshire.html" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Fencing Men&#039;s</p>
<p><strong>19:07</strong> Goals, goals and more goals for the York boys as its now 8-5 in the water polo.</p>
<p><strong>19:07</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Netball 1sts <strong>45-31</strong></p>
<p><strong>19:02</strong> York are back in the lead and the shot which resulted in the goal was so ferocious that the net ended up being wrapped around the post, BOOOOOOOM.</p>
<p><strong>18:59</strong> An interesting water polo debate has arisen surrounding the shallow and deep end. Surely its a massive advantage to have your goal in the deep end for the last quarter as its easier to score in the shallow end as you can stand. The advantage comes in the last quarter as the players are more tired so treading water becomes tougher. I&#039;m sure someone can make me look silly with an answer to that. The score is 5-5 in the water polo now by the way.</p>
<p><strong>18:54</strong> 36-28 to Lancaster in the netball with not long to go.</p>
<p><strong>18:47</strong> The waterpolo is now 3-3 and its a very enjoyable spectacle. The badminton boys are all fired up in their new Roses strip, unconfirmed reports say that they are pink, this should be worth a watch.</p>
<p><strong>18:36</strong> Men&#039;s waterpolo and an early score for Lancaster puts them ahead. I&#039;m getting the hang of this polo water malarkey, where are the horses though?</p>
<p><strong>18:31</strong> Sorry hockey enquirer, little slow on the actual score. Everyone knew Lancaster were winning but couldn&#039;t tell me what the actual score was, even the players. The poor fellas took a real hammering: 5 - 0 in the end. I would have stayed longer but there was a really annoying guy with a loudspeaker, so I left!</p>
<p><strong>18:26</strong> Just in case you were really concerned about the netball 4ths and mixed hockey 4ths, they didn&#039;t happen. No great loss.</p>
<p><strong>18:23</strong> To all you fencing fans, it&#039;s 20-10 to York in the second weapon (yeh, that&#039;s right we know our fencing lingo!) and we won the first weapon too. Win this one and that&#039;s another 4 points for York!</p>
<p><strong>18:20</strong> Netball 1sts are struggling as we go into the 2nd quarter, 14-8 was the score at the break but it moves so fast I can&#039;t keep up! Lucky there&#039;s official scorers.
I&#039;ve also noted the majority of York&#039;s football club are watching the netball girls, obviously with the exception of Tom Wilson who tragically has had to head home after losing a tooth and injuring a wrist. The football 1sts will be weakened without him tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>18:12</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Waterpolo Women&#039;s <strong>11-1</strong></p>
<p><strong>18:08</strong> The sports centre is the place to be with netball, fencing and water polo all a stone&#039;s throw from each other. The day has a more relaxed feel about it now with the evening session of sport kicking off.</p>
<p><strong>18:00</strong> Reports are coming in about mindgames at the Rugby. The kicker for the conversion that could have won the game was surrounded by York fans who were chanting &quot;Yorkshire, Yorkshire, Yorkshire!&quot; at him. He bottled it. The ball flew wide (albeit pretty close). We drew and the points were shared. Get in!</p>
<p><strong>17:55</strong> Oh, and it&#039;s 7-0 to Lancaster. We&#039;re taking a pounding but we&#039;ve got a 26 point lead so shouldn&#039;t affect too much.</p>
<p><strong>17:55</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_draw.html" alt="Draw" /> <strong>Draw!</strong> Netball 4ths</p>
<p><strong>17:55</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_draw.html" alt="Draw" /> <strong>Draw!</strong> Hockey  Mixed 4ths</p>
<p><strong>17:54</strong> Waterpolo girls got back in the pool, told you I knew what was going on.</p>
<p><strong>17:53</strong> Correction: The women&#039;s waterpolo is currently 5-0 to Lancaster so me thinking it was 1-1 after a minute or so was fairly stupid. They&#039;ve all just got out the pool but I&#039;m pretty sure they&#039;ll get back in. It&#039;s all up in the air, mainly because my knowledge of waterpolo is limited. I&#039;m going to try Wikipedia then write a full match report soon.</p>
<p><strong>17:49</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Netball 2nds <strong>43-37</strong></p>
<p><strong>17:49</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_draw.html" alt="Draw" /> <strong>Draw!</strong> Rugby Union Men&#039;s 1sts <strong>10-10</strong></p>
<p><strong>17:45</strong> Rugby 1sts; Lancaster score in the corner but coversion is missed so they draw 10-10. Almost as exciting as the Lancaster fans running across the pitch to confront the York fans. Lots of handbags and no-one got hit so great to watch!</p>
<p><strong>17:36</strong> Women&#039;s waterpolo is underway but only partly underwater. 1-1 already after a minute or so - this is thrilling stuff!</p>

<p><strong>17:20</strong> The Lancaster AU President is obviously feeling the heat as York stride into a commanding lead. He still holds out hope though claiming &quot;Sunday should be a strong day for us&quot;. Pah, we&#039;re nailing you Lancaster!</p>
<p><strong>01:33</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_yorkshire.html" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Fencing Men&#039;s 2nds</p>
<p><strong>01:33</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_yorkshire.html" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Fencing Women&#039;s</p>
<p><strong>17:14</strong> Netball 2nds are ahead by 1 at half time. Current score 21-20. Lots of whooping and shrieking! My ears hurt and my head hurts but it&#039;ll all be worth it when we win!</p>
<p><strong>17:12</strong> James Wilson intercepts the ball and runs in from 60 yards. The York boys are pumped up. Conversion successful. 5-10 York.</p>
<p><strong>17:08</strong> More streakers at the rugby, horrible fat lads. Not as funny as before, no novelty dance moves or boobs (just moobs(man boobs)).</p>
<p><strong>01:33</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Hockey  Men&#039;s 3rds <strong>5-0</strong></p>

<p><strong>16:50</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Football Men&#039;s 3rds <strong>3-0</strong></p>
<p><strong>16:49</strong> York&#039;s rugby men are battling well but Lancaster seem much bigger. A penalty gives York their first points. 5-3</p>

<p><strong>16:31</strong> Lancaster score in the men&#039;s rugby. The crowd goes wild. The conversion is missed. 5 - 0 Lancs.</p>
<p><strong>16:11</strong> Still 2-0 Lancs in men&#039;s football thirds. York are going for it but no real chance on goal.</p>
<p><strong>16:09</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_yorkshire.html" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Netball 3rds <strong>19-27</strong></p>
<p><strong>16:05</strong> Rugby has kicked off, the Lancaster lot are all sporting bleach blonde hair and there&#039;s a clown doing the rounds.</p>
<p><strong>16:01</strong> York are on top of the men&#039;s tennis after the doubles but singles are only in the 1st set.</p>
<p><strong>16:00</strong> The colonel from the basketball team is not happy with the officiating in the volleyball. His Hawk-Eye like brain saw the ball was out.</p>
<p><strong>15:58</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Volleyball Women&#039;s <strong>3-0</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:52</strong> Poor Jay Hewitt&#039;s putting up with shouts of &quot;Number 2&#039;s a rapist&quot; at the football. These appear to be unfounded.</p>
<p><strong>01:33</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_yorkshire.html" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Snooker Mixed <strong>2-3</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:49</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_yorkshire.html" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Rugby Union Women&#039;s 1sts <strong>0-10</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:49</strong> York women seal the win with a late converted try.</p>
<p><strong>15:41</strong> Goal to Lancaster in the footy. 2-0 and not looking good. The crowd are getting on Jay Hewitt&#039;s back. Not literally, that would be silly.</p>
<p><strong>15:35</strong> I&#039;ve heard of a three legged race, but one on each leg? I guess that&#039;s four legged? The rugby boys are clearly enjoying the atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>15:35</strong> According to a banner, the York netball club want to &#039;eat some win&#039;. Fair play to them, let&#039;s hope Lancaster don&#039;t eat away at York&#039;s Roses lead.</p>
<p><strong>15:35</strong> Latest on the football, Parris Williams is in an ambulance with a suspected dislocated jaw. Tom Wilson is already in hospital and will miss tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>15:32</strong> Despite good play from York, Lancaster have won the second set of the women&#039;s volleyball 25-18.</p>
<p><strong>15:31</strong> At the netball now, getting some fresh air away from the somewhat sauna-like sports centre. There is a severe lack of slam dunking for my liking.</p>
<p><strong>15:31</strong> 14-8 to York at half-time in the netball. Go girls!</p>
<p><strong>15:25</strong> Men&#039;s football 3rds are 1 down but captain Will Broadhurst has just thrown a ball 30 yards so I fancy a come-back! Plus Joe Brennan is on fire.</p>
<p><strong>15:16</strong> Currently 3-0 York in women&#039;s rugby and York is all over them. A missed penalty kick means York missed out on doubling their lead.</p>
<p><strong>15:11</strong> Idiot with a loudspeaker is ruining men&#039;s hockey 3rds, plus we&#039;re losing 4-0. I&#039;m not bitter...</p>
<p><strong>15:06</strong> First set to the Lancaster in the volleyball winning 25-15.</p>
<p><strong>14:56</strong> York are winning the men&#039;s B for all you fencing fans.</p>
<p><strong>14:53</strong> Not quite the beach volleyball you see on the telly but I&#039;m getting into this women&#039;s volleyball. Crowd are loving it to, 8-3 Lancaster in the first set.</p>
<p><strong>14:50</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Trampolining Novice <strong>145.8-142.1</strong></p>
<p><strong>14:44</strong> The big man Mike Walsh has knocked in a 31 break on his way to victory, meaning that York have now taken an unassailable 3-0 lead in the snooker. More points for the York boys, we&#039;re starting to run away with it.</p>
<p><strong>14:40</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_yorkshire.html" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Hockey  Mixed 1sts <strong>2-5</strong></p>
<p><strong>14:37</strong> Fencing has indeed begun anonymous commenter, there is a decent crowd watching as well. I will enquire about the score in a few minutes. There&#039;s not enough sword fighting in this day and age, I would much prefer differences to be settled by a joust instead of this stabbing business. Just call me old fashioned.</p>
<p><strong>14:31</strong> With minutes remaining the York mixed hockey 1sts are leading 4-2 looking to extend this already large lead that York own in the overall Roses picture.</p>
<p><strong>01:33</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_yorkshire.html" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Tennis Women&#039;s 1sts <strong>4-11</strong></p>
<p><strong>14:28</strong> Sned and Greg are now wearing Yorker hats while walking around Lancaster, so if you see them don&#039;t be afraid to show your gratitude to them for this wonderful live blog by running up to them and hugging or kissing them.</p>
<p><strong>14:14</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_yorkshire.html" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Tennis Men&#039;s 2nds</p>
<p><strong>14:08</strong> Football finished 1-0 to the York 1sts but the game was marred by outrageous tackles from the Lancashire lads. It culminated in Tom Wilson losing a tooth. The atmosphere was intensified by the whole club chanting &#039;Yorkshire, Yorkshire, Yorkshire!&#039; Fingers crossed Wilson is fit for tomorrow&#039;s 11-a-side. Greg&#039;s now glad he wasn&#039;t playing and has his teeth intact.</p>
<p><strong>13:59</strong> The netball has started and York trail 11-5 to the best of my knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>13:58</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Indoor Football Women&#039;s 1sts <strong>4-1</strong></p>
<p><strong>13:54</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_yorkshire.html" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Indoor Football Men&#039;s 1sts <strong>0-1</strong></p>
<p><strong>13:54</strong> I predict A Whyatt - Andrew Whyatt comes from 1-0 down to win his pool match to give York a 2-0 lead in the first 3 match.</p>
<p><strong>13:51</strong> Tom Wilson, 1st team footballer, has just had a tooth knocked out. All getting very heated!</p>
<p><strong>13:49</strong> Some great action at the tennis, short skirts, tight tops. Oh wait, I&#039;m here to report. I&#039;ll have to watch for a bit longer.</p>
<p><strong>01:33</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_yorkshire.html" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Rugby Union Men&#039;s 2nds <strong>12-14</strong></p>
<p><strong>13:39</strong> <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> sports team&#039;s combined hangover is the weight of the world. But we&#039;re powering on through. Red bull number 6 is about to be purchased.</p>
<p><strong>13:36</strong> Men&#039;s 1sts indoor football is still 0-0. Greg&#039;s very angry he&#039;s not playing (he&#039;s injured, that&#039;s not a pop at Dom O&#039;Shea&#039;s tactics). Women&#039;s 1sts lost 4-1 unfortunately.</p>
<p><strong>13:33</strong> Quick review of the Roses event last night: Messy. York guys and girls seemed to forget all the rivalry and partied with the Lancaster students like it was 1999. Most were just looking for an alternative to sleeping on a lecture theatre floor but no doubt some romance blossomed. Speaking of which, Caroline has written on Sneddon&#039;s wall apparently. He&#039;s so smitten.</p>
<p><strong>13:33</strong> Matt Robson has won his match by 2 frames to nil to give York the early advantage.</p>
<p><strong>13:29</strong> The basketball boys have arrived for tomorrow&#039;s big game, they say they want to &#039;conquer Athens&#039;. The colonel is also in fine form.</p>
<p><strong>13:26</strong> At the tennis the women&#039;s match hasn&#039;t attracted as big a crowd as expected, probably because rugby is on across the road. They&#039;re no Kournikova but there&#039;s short, white skirts flapping around left, right and centre! The men&#039;s 1sts start in half an hour and despite them being more Andy Murray than Rafael Nadal it&#039;s eyecandy for lonely Yorker reporters nonetheless.</p>
<p><strong>13:23</strong> Snooker update- Matt Robson is 1-0 up and well placed to win his second frame while Andrew Whyatt is 1-1. It&#039;s 5 best of 3 matches.</p>
<p><strong>13:20</strong> Mixed hockey 1sts are winning 2-0. Whoop whoop! Good crowd, good atmosphere, good Roses.</p>
<p><strong>13:16</strong> Laurie Swan was epic in a 4-0 trouncing of Lancaster&#039;s 5-a-side football 2nd team. 2 penalties from &#039;the Swan&#039; plus goals from Dan &#039;Coxy&#039; Cox and Richard &#039;Remi&#039; Remington secured the result. Footballers really are imaginative with their nicknames aren&#039;t they...</p>
<p><strong>13:15</strong> York are attacking in the rugby 2nds as they trail 12-11. There&#039;s plenty of blowing out there as the players are feeling the burn.</p>
<p><strong>13:09</strong> Reports of a half time streaker at the rugby. He did the worm and then slid in the mud. The weekend wouldn&#039;t have been complete without it.</p>
<p><strong>13:03</strong> Apologies for the lack of humourous chat today. Me (Sned) and Greg are slightly hungover and are being rushed off our feet. Banter will be back soon.</p>
<p><strong>13:00</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Hockey  Mixed 2nds <strong>2-0</strong></p>
<p><strong>12:58</strong> The mixed 2nds hockey look like they are slipping to defeat as they are 2-0 on the astro.</p>
<p><strong>12:56</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_yorkshire.html" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Indoor Football Men&#039;s 2nds <strong>0-4</strong></p>
<p><strong>12:49</strong> 1-0 at half time to York in the latest installment of this footballing bonanza, it&#039;s men&#039;s 2nds on now.</p>
<p><strong>12:39</strong> I&#039;ve found a nice quiet corner in the sports centre to take a 5 minute break from all the hullabaloo, the action is unbelievably tight and this could genuinely go down to the last few events tomorrow. Better get a good night&#039;s sleep tonight, sport players. Still nothing from Mitch yet, he must be enjoying himself too much I reckon.</p>
<p><strong>12:34</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_draw.html" alt="Draw" /> <strong>Draw!</strong> Indoor Football Men&#039;s 3rds <strong>3-3</strong></p>
<p><strong>12:32</strong> Men&#039;s tennis 2nd team are cruising to victory while the women&#039;s 1sts just started. Mixed hockey 2nds still 1-0 down though, c&#039;mon Yorkie!</p>
<p><strong>12:23</strong> 3-3 now, York have taken their foot off the gas and have been punished. Will their keeper have the last laugh?</p>
<p><strong>12:17</strong> 3 penalties and it&#039;s 3-1 to York. Triston Holdsworth has scored all 3 and stuck them the same way each time. The keeper is copping plenty of slack.</p>
<p><strong>12:12</strong> There&#039;s plenty of chat at the football. The Lancaster keeper has been described as &#039;living in a dustbin&#039; and he&#039;s already conceded twice. 2-0 York</p>
<p><strong>12:11</strong> Rugby men&#039;s 2nds are underway. Good crowd, loud music but no score. So much sport, so little time...</p>
<p><strong>12:09</strong> Regular Yorker readers will know who Mitch is, today he is our ballroom dancing correspondant. I bet he will still comment on this.</p>
<p><strong>01:33</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Indoor Football Women&#039;s 2nds <strong>4-0</strong></p>
<p><strong>12:03</strong> Some big games getting underway now with women&#039;s tennis, snooker, sailing, rugby and even a bit of ballroom dancing. Whatever next?</p>
<p><strong>12:02</strong> Goal to Lancaster in mixed hockey 2nds, 1-0 for sure but confusion in lacrosse as even the refs lost count! Some said 15-2, others 18-2. We say 16-2!</p>
<p><strong>11:59</strong> The girls are taking a beating at the indoor football. 3-0 to Lancaster and looking comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>11:56</strong> One of the judo competitors has been described as being &#039;butterbean&#039;, another girl just called it &#039;homoerotic&#039;. These are not the views of <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>.</p>
<p><strong>11:51</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_yorkshire.html" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Lacrosse Men&#039;s <strong>2-16</strong></p>
<p><strong>11:49</strong> The Roses weekend is living up to expectations and is a sports fan&#039;s dream. At the minute there is power lifting, judo, football, hockey, lacrosse and tennis. Fill your boots, lads.</p>
<p><strong>11:46</strong> Women&#039;s football is about to begin. There&#039;s a festival of football on indoors today with 5-a-side going on throughout the day. Ole I say</p>
<p><strong>11:42</strong> Lacrosse guys are destroying Lancaster and we&#039;re in the last quarter. I don&#039;t fully understand but there&#039;s lots of aggro. And another goal for York!</p>
<p><strong>11:36</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_yorkshire.html" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Indoor Football Men&#039;s 4ths <strong>3-4</strong></p>
<p><strong>11:34</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Hockey  Mixed 3rds <strong>5-4</strong></p>
<p><strong>11:33</strong> A corker indoors as it&#039;s now 3-3, not long left now. The action is coming thick and fast. Penalty scored by York, 4-3.</p>
<p><strong>11:24</strong> The scratch 4th team football are 2-1 down at half time.</p>
<p><strong>11:22</strong> I doubt I could lift some of these weights the power lifters are doing if I had a fork lift. There is rolling in the judo? Don&#039;t really understand it.</p>
<p><strong>11:04</strong> Panic at the football as the lads forget to sort out a 4th team, a scratch team is getting put out with fingers being pointed at Richards.</p>
<p><strong>11:00</strong> After last night&#039;s debauchery the sight of big men in not very much lifting lots isn&#039;t too appealing; fortunately judo is soon to start next door.</p>
<p><strong>10:46</strong> Who&#039;s going to win it then boys and girls? A cheeky tenner between friends says the Yorkie can walk away with it. I&#039;m sure everything will be a lot clearer tonight.</p>
<p><strong>10:42</strong> Sned and Greg have now arrived at the sports centre and are ready for action. Stay tuned for all the results from here, there and everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>09:47</strong> Cries of &#039;show them the whole thing&#039; and &#039;you are not ready yet&#039; (said with a muscley voice) are eminating from the power lifting. I love it.</p>
<p><strong>09:29</strong> The second and biggest day of Roses starts with the two universities neck and neck, York having successfully reduced the deficit to just one point.</p>
<p>With so many points on offer the competition could well be decided by the end of the day, so pay close attention to how things unfold.</p>
<p>Stay with us for all the day&#039;s results and <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>&#039;s sports team comments, reports and banter.</p>
