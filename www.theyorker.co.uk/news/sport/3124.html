		<div class="SubText">Tuesday and Thursday saw four more College Cup group games in the sun on the JLD Astroturf. None of the games quite matched the drama of Monday but there was plenty of goals, controversy and face paint.</div>

        <p>A lacklustre Goodricke firsts side limped past Halifax seconds to kick off Thursday&rsquo;s action. The smell of Ziggys was thick in the air as the game kicked off in humid conditions with Halifax keen to cause an upset. Goodricke threatened early on with Dave Coupland picking up where he left off from on Monday and Ronan Joyce crashing a header against the bar. After the bright start, the Goodricke play started to become riddled with mistakes with possession being gifted away cheaply and tackles not being made. With all the talent on display for Goodricke, they were lumping the ball up front a surprising amount and Halifax dealt with most of the long ball threat with aplomb.</p>
<p>As the first half went on, Halifax came out of their shell and turned possession into territory and then into chances. The Halifax strikers tested goalkeeper James Mortimer a couple of times before the break and Halifax went in at least deserving to be level. Goodricke captain Leadbeater decided to change things up with Coupland moving out to the left and Ben Smith moving up top. This seemed to make a difference as Goodricke pressed with a series of corners before Dom O&rsquo;Shea broke the deadlock. Centre-half Chris Grayland picked up the ball just over the half way line before meeting eyes with O&rsquo;Shea and drifting a wonderful ball into the box which O&rsquo;Shea buried. Goodricke looked the more likely after the goal with O&rsquo;Shea forcing a great save out of Seamus Kent and Smith could only spoon the ball over the bar from the rebound. Goodricke got the three points but know they will have to improve to progress past the quarter-finals.</p>
<p>The second game on Thursday saw Alcuin seconds play out an entertaining draw with Derwent thirds. Long throw specialist (it is massive!) Liam Griffin opened the scoring Derwent as he received the ball in the D and slid the ball under the advancing goalkeeper. Alcuin then equalised through their skipper Thomas Gibby as he smashed home after a half cleared cross. Derwent then began to have the better of it as Griffin bombarded the Alcuin goal with long throw after long throw. Eventually the second goal came as Griffin hurled a throw to the far post where it was headed against the bar before Adam Cliff scrambled the ball in. Gibby then smashed the ball goalward for Alcuin and the tiger faced Krish Yellappa could only parry the ball into the net. The draw was probably about a fair result for this exciting tussle.</p>
<p>Tuesday&rsquo;s action brought wonder goals and controversy, all in a day&rsquo;s work for the College Cup. Halifax firsts comfortably beat James seconds 2-0 without ever really getting going. James were content to try to defend their way to a goalless draw and did not test the gloveless Seamus Kent in the Halifax goal. Alex Richards was the main Halifax threat from midfield as he had chances with a header and a bicycle kick before whipping in two dangerous free kicks.</p>
<p>The game was not the greatest of spectacles and needed a moment of magic to breathe some life into the game. This came from a spectacular overhead kick from Connor Brennan after Dom Green picked him out perfectly. Despite this, Halifax continued to go through the motions and their lead was never really threatened. Shaun Evans wrapped the game up from the penalty spot after he was hauled down while on a mazy run.</p>
<p>A much better spectacle was Vanbrugh thirds running Derwent seconds all the way before succumbing to a 4-2 defeat. Ed Lacaille opened the scoring for Derwent with a peach of a strike after a drilled through ball from James Grey. Vanbrugh struck back straight away with a highly controversial goal which didn&rsquo;t cross the goal line. A harmless corner was spilt by David Attwood at his near post and Tom McQuillan poked the ball goalwards forcing a goalline clearance. The Derwent players looked on in disbelief as the referee awarded a goal and the Vanbrugh players ran bemused back to their half. Derwent then began to dominate as Lacaille doubled his tally with a curled shot into the far corner to ensure Derwent led at the break.</p>
<p>The second half began as the first had finished with Derwent having much of the ball and they threatened from a couple of corners. Against the run of play, Vanbrugh equalised through Andy Dakin and again there were suspicions about the goal. The ball was half cleared from a corner and put back in the mixer, finding its way to Dakin at the back post for him to slot home from a debatably onside position. This goal reinvigorated Vanbrugh but they ran out of steam and a header from Paul Ward-Jones, followed by a delightful lobbed overhead kick from Jamie Tyler sealed the victory for Derwent.</p>
