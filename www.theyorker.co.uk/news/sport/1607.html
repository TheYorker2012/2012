<h3> 12.30 David Nicholson Mares Hurdle </h3>

<p>Chomba Womba beat Theatre Girl by 3/4 of a length at Doncaster. A step up in trip and Robert Thornton on board could help Theatre Girl make up the difference, yet a better bet can be found in <strong>Gaspara</strong>. She is a horse that simply hasn&#039;t been able to repeat her great novices form this year. She hasn&#039;t run a bad race, but has never been able to get in-front either. A visor is finally being tried with her, after five frustrating places this year, which could make all the difference. It worked for Pipe&#039;s yard on Our Vic yesterday. Her form is especially encouraging when we consider that her places have come against World Hurdle opposition such as Blazing Bailey.</p>
<p>Labelthou finished clear of Refinement and Gaspara at Ascot and I think both of those could frank the form today. Gaspara&#039;s new visor will help her focus and Refinement can do so as AP McCoy takes the reins on her today.</p>
<p>2pts <strong>Gaspara</strong> (9.4 on Betfair)</p>


<h3> 1.05 Ballymore Properties Novices&#039; Hurdle </h3>

<p><strong>GTT:</strong> This is a wide open affair, and at least two budding reputations are going to be put to the sword. After yesterday&rsquo;s opening Novices&rsquo; Hurdle however, it looks like we should not get too heavily involved here. The principals in the betting all look too short to be worth following in such a competitive race, so it might be worth taking a punt on an outsider.</p>
<p><strong>Lightening Strike</strong> has shown form as good as anyone else here, and showed his return to form with an encouraging run under a penalty last time out. Yesterday showed that it takes a horse with real stamina to win at this festival, especially if the wind and rain are set to stay. The selection has shown he has the guts and loves the conditions, so is worth an each way nibble.</p>
<p>Whatuthink is another with useful form in the book, but doubts about the distance and his attitude mean we can pass over him today.</p>

<ul><li>1 pt <strong>Lightening Strike</strong> to win (55 on Betfair)

</li><li>1 pt <strong>Lightening Strike</strong> to place (11 on Betfair)
</li></ul>


<h3> 1.40 Coral Cup </h3>

<p><strong>SNEER:</strong> The favourite, Leg Spinner, last won a flat race in October, yet it is unclear how relevant that form will be in deciding today&rsquo;s outcome. Naiad du Misselot took well to a similar trip (and going) at Haydock, but his 9lbs rise for that victory may take its toll. County Zen is one horse that appeals for this. He has been risen 4lbs for a place at Newbury. Punjabi was 2nd that day which strengthens the form (since he finished 3rd in the Champion Hurdle yesterday). County Zen&rsquo;s credentials mean that <strong>Song of Songs</strong> cannot be ignored here either. He was just a length away from County Zen in November and now finds himself 5lbs better off, having won twice since then.</p>
<p><strong>Warne&rsquo;s Way</strong> is an outsider with a great chance of being placed. He was a length and two lengths away from Lough Derg and The Tother One respectively this season and the slightly shorter trip looks set to suit him. I would not be surprised if the price for this horse shortens during the day.</p>

<ul><li>2pts <strong>Song of Songs</strong> (9/1 on Paddypower.com &ndash; stake returned if 2nd to SP favourite)

</li><li>1pt <strong>Warne&rsquo;s Way</strong> to be placed (6.6 on Betfair)
</li></ul>


<h3> 2.15 Triumph Hurdle </h3>

<p>The hype concerning this race is rightfully all about <strong>Franchoek</strong>. He may even go off at evens on the day, so get your bets in early. He is trained by Alan King, who has won this race twice in three years. More importantly he has been likened to Champion Hurdle winner Katchit in success and racing spirit. Franchoek has won four out of five and the loss came when he gave 7lbs away and was forced to make the running himself. That certainly will not happen today and Franchoek will enjoy running just off of the pace set by others.</p>
<p>Fivedream is very well-fancied and could be one to watch out for with first time blinkers on today. But he was an inexplicably poor seventh last time out and it is unlikely that the new blinkers will turn form like that into a Triumph Hurdle victory. More worryingly Ruby Walsh has opted to ride Celestial Halo. That horse has questions to answer too, as he was beaten by Sentry Duty who since went on to run a very poor race in the Supreme Novices Hurdle. With questionmarks over many of his rivals, Franchoek looks set to walk away with this one.</p>

<ul><li>4pts <strong>Franchoek</strong> (6/4 on Skybet.com)
</li></ul>


<h3> 3.30 Gold Cup </h3>

<p>Nothing is ever certain in horse-racing, except that Nicholls will have the 1-2 in the Gold Cup, but which horse will win? The only danger for <strong>Kauto Star</strong> and Denman, ridiculous as it may sound, is that they may set off too fast and allow others to rein them in late on. What pace Denman would need to set to tire himself is probably quite frightening. However, a few such as Exotic Dancer, with an RPR of 184, are worth an each-way bet at odds of 12/1.</p>
<p>I am in the Kauto Star camp for this one. Denman has been exceptional this year, but the quality of the opposition that he has destroyed is questionable. He has finished ahead of Regal Heights, Dream Alliance and Mossbank so far. Yet, Kauto has beaten the likes of Our Vic, Exotic Dancer and Monet&#039;s Garden into 2nd. This must be a worry for anyone looking to back Denman. The only blip for Kauto Star was losing to Monet&#039;s Garden over a shorter trip, when giving the grey a stone. That form has since been reversed however. Kauto Star is the same price to win it as he was last year, when many worried about his jumping. This time people are worried about the power of his stablemate, but I think Kauto Star will prove the critics wrong again and retain his title.</p>

<ul><li>5pts <strong> Kauto Star</strong> (5/4 Paddypower.com)
</li></ul>


<h3> 4.40 Grand Annual </h3>

<p>My first advice in this competitive handicap is to avoid Crozan. Every other horse has won over this distance. My Petra has to be respected here for finishing second to Noland at Sandown, yet there is little other solid form to justify his favouritism. <strong>Howle Hill</strong> looks a very good value bet as he was just 8 lengths behind Master Minded, who won at a canter yesterday. He can be excused for a poor run last time in the company of Kauto Star at a further than ideal trip. Before that the introduction of blinkers gave him a win at Doncaster, finishing ahead of four of today&#039;s opponents. He still looks good at the weights compared to them, except perhaps Bambi De L&#039;Orme. Some believe Andreas could improve on that as he wasn&#039;t at peak fitness that day. Andreas won this race last year but to make up 22 lengths on Howle Hill is a big ask.</p>
<p>Another former winner of the race, <strong>Greenhope</strong>, appeals slightly more. He has had a long break from the course due to injuries but Nicky Henderson is a trainer with an excellent record here and he could have him well enough to go close. No horse carrying more than 10st 11lbs has won this since the great Edredon Bleu in 1998. Greenhope fits that trend and has a chance here.</p>

<ul><li>1pt <strong>Howle Hill</strong> win (16.5 on Betfair)

</li><li>1pt <strong>Howle Hill</strong> to be placed (4.2 on Betfair)

</li><li>1pt <strong>Greenhope</strong> to be placed (5.8 on Betfair)
</li></ul>
