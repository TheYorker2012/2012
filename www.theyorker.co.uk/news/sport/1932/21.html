		<div class="SubText">Goodricke 1sts 6 - 1 Goodricke 2nds</div>

        <p><strong>There was no major shock today as the expected difference in class shone through resulting in Goodricke 1sts demolishing their 2nd team counterparts 6-1. A spirited first half from the 2nds was not enough as Goodricke 1sts smashed home five second half goals.</strong></p>
<p>Adam Lewis&rsquo; 1st team had to shuffle their defence before the game as centre back Grayland and left-back York were missing. Remington stepped back into the left-back slot after returning from injury while Oatridge slotted into the centre of the back four. Self professed &lsquo;goal machine&rsquo; Ramsden missed the start of the game due to an exam, the same exam deprived the 2nd team of tenacious midfielder Barrett until half time.</p>
<p>Without Barrett and cross-over players Leadbitter and Smith, a new look central midfield partnership of Twaddle and Goldring took to the field, attempting to stop the 1st team midfield from getting the ball down and playing.</p>
<p>For the first ten minutes, the tactic of stopping Goodricke 1sts from playing seemed to work, with the midfield often giving the ball to their full backs to get the ball forward, only forcing a corner and a wayward half volley from High.</p>
<p>The midfield of Goodricke 2nds couldn&rsquo;t keep up this constant running and tracking though and university 1st team players O&rsquo;Shea and Wilson were beginning to find space on the ball and the time to thread passes to Grafham and Silson. One such pass started the move which saw Grafham cooly slot the ball past goalkeeper Kennedy to make the score 1-0.</p>
<p>Many would have predicted this goal to open the flood gates but the 2nds fought back strongly and dominated for small periods creating two half chances. A great move, switching the play from right to left with one touch passing, resulted in Goldring swinging in a cross to which Senchal met only for the header to go wide.</p>
<p>Another move saw combative striker Hanlon and mullet-ed midfielder Leadbitter clash in the air, with Hanlon winning the ball setting away Senchal who crossed for Coupland. At an awkward height, Coupland could do little more than prod a weak volley goalwards.</p>
<p>Chances for Wilson and Silson were squandered before half time and a break by 2nd team striker Myhill resulted in a tame effort from Senchal. Half time came with both teams being pleased with how the half had gone.The introduction of Barrett for the 2nds gave the midfield more bite and it was felt that if the 2nds could hold the 1sts at bay for 15 minutes then there was every chance of taking the game to penalties.</p>
<p>This was not to be though as Silson struck a one-on-one into the onion bag before Wilson slid home at the back post from a Silson cross. 3-0 and the game looked over as Ramsden was introduced into the fray. His first action was to fall over as the ball approached him, his legs reminiscent of a baby deer learning to walk for the 1st time. There was a feeling that, even though the 2nd team were shipping goals, Ramsden&rsquo;s name was not to be on the score sheet for a second successive match.</p>
<p>The rest of the game was not as competitive as the first half as most players realised the game was out of reach, with O&rsquo;Shea bagging himself a brace before 2nd team manager Sneddon brought himself on for his debut and managed to drill one home for a consolation goal.</p>
<p>Wilson rounded off proceedings with a curled free-kick, however the dubious goals committee may have to award the goal as an own goal to Senchal.</p>
<p>2nd team manager, Michael Sneddon concluded that the 1sts &ldquo;certainly deserved to go through, but the scoreline may not have done the game justice.&quot; He added that &ldquo;the first half was very close and a couple of quick goals, perhaps a sloppy start to the second half from us, took the game away and killed the dream, allowing the 1st team to run riot.&quot;</p>
<p>Man of the match Dom O&rsquo;Shea (Goodricke 1sts) was &ldquo;pleased with how he played&rdquo; and added that he &ldquo;likes the Astroturf because you can trust the roll of the ball and be more effective in a game.&rdquo;  He described his two goals today as &ldquo;a bonus&rdquo; and described the team&#039;s performance in the tournament as &ldquo;good so far&rdquo; but &ldquo;aware of tougher tests lying ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Goodricke 1sts captain Adam Lewis echoed these sentiments saying that some of his players were a bit &ldquo;lethargic&rdquo; but that &ldquo;will change next game.&rdquo; With players returning for the semi-final, Lewis admits to having &ldquo;dilemmas all over the pitch now we&rsquo;ve got a full squad, some class players such as Barrett, Riley and predatory striker Sneddon won&rsquo;t even make the squad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talking about the tournament as a whole, Lewis mentioned how he &ldquo;disliked the title of favourites as Alcuin are definitely favourites, but the players know we have a chance when we play our best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a farcical sub plot to today&rsquo;s action, Lewis was given the run around in the first half by Coupland but refused to admit that it was because Coupland was the better man. Instead he blamed his trainers, as his boots were falling apart and a nail was digging into his feet. My advice to Lewis would be to buy a pair of boots that are not from the 1950s.</p>
