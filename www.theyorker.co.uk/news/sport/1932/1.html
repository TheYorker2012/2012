		<div class="SubText">Goodricke 1sts 6 - 1 Goodricke 2nds</div>

        <p><strong>There was no major shock today as the expected difference in class shone through resulting in Goodricke 1sts demolishing their 2nd team counterparts 6-1. A spirited first half from the 2nds was not enough as Goodricke 1sts smashed home five second half goals.</strong></p>
<p>Adam Lewis&rsquo; 1st team had to shuffle their defence before the game as centre back Grayland and left-back York were missing. Remington stepped back into the left-back slot after returning from injury while Oatridge slotted into the centre of the back four. Self professed &lsquo;goal machine&rsquo; Ramsden missed the start of the game due to an exam, the same exam deprived the 2nd team of tenacious midfielder Barrett until half time.</p>
<p>Without Barrett and cross-over players Leadbitter and Smith, a new look central midfield partnership of Twaddle and Goldring took to the field, attempting to stop the 1st team midfield from getting the ball down and playing.</p>
<p>For the first ten minutes, the tactic of stopping Goodricke 1sts from playing seemed to work, with the midfield often giving the ball to their full backs to get the ball forward, only forcing a corner and a wayward half volley from High.</p>
<p>The midfield of Goodricke 2nds couldn&rsquo;t keep up this constant running and tracking though and university 1st team players O&rsquo;Shea and Wilson were beginning to find space on the ball and the time to thread passes to Grafham and Silson. One such pass started the move which saw Grafham cooly slot the ball past goalkeeper Kennedy to make the score 1-0.</p>
<p>Many would have predicted this goal to open the flood gates but the 2nds fought back strongly and dominated for small periods creating two half chances. A great move, switching the play from right to left with one touch passing, resulted in Goldring swinging in a cross to which Senchal met only for the header to go wide.</p>
<p>Another move saw combative striker Hanlon and mullet-ed midfielder Leadbitter clash in the air, with Hanlon winning the ball setting away Senchal who crossed for Coupland. At an awkward height, Coupland could do little more than prod a weak volley goalwards.</p>
<p>Chances for Wilson and Silson were squandered before half time and a break by 2nd team striker Myhill resulted in a tame effort from Senchal. Half time came with both teams being pleased with how the half had gone.The introduction of Barrett for the 2nds gave the midfield more bite and it was felt that if the 2nds could hold the 1sts at bay for 15 minutes then there was every chance of taking the game to penalties.</p>
<p>This was not to be though as Silson struck a one-on-one into the onion bag before Wilson slid home at the back post from a Silson cross. 3-0 and the game looked over as Ramsden was introduced into the fray. His first action was to fall over as the ball approached him, his legs reminiscent of a baby deer learning to walk for the 1st time. There was a feeling that, even though the 2nd team were shipping goals, Ramsden&rsquo;s name was not to be on the score sheet for a second successive match.</p>
<p>The rest of the game was not as competitive as the first half as most players realised the game was out of reach, with O&rsquo;Shea bagging himself a brace before 2nd team manager Sneddon brought himself on for his debut and managed to drill one home for a consolation goal.</p>
<p>Wilson rounded off proceedings with a curled free-kick, however the dubious goals committee may have to award the goal as an own goal to Senchal.</p>
<p>2nd team manager, Michael Sneddon concluded that the 1sts &ldquo;certainly deserved to go through, but the scoreline may not have done the game justice.&quot; He added that &ldquo;the first half was very close and a couple of quick goals, perhaps a sloppy start to the second half from us, took the game away and killed the dream, allowing the 1st team to run riot.&quot;</p>
<p>Man of the match Dom O&rsquo;Shea (Goodricke 1sts) was &ldquo;pleased with how he played&rdquo; and added that he &ldquo;likes the Astroturf because you can trust the roll of the ball and be more effective in a game.&rdquo;  He described his two goals today as &ldquo;a bonus&rdquo; and described the team&#039;s performance in the tournament as &ldquo;good so far&rdquo; but &ldquo;aware of tougher tests lying ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Goodricke 1sts captain Adam Lewis echoed these sentiments saying that some of his players were a bit &ldquo;lethargic&rdquo; but that &ldquo;will change next game.&rdquo; With players returning for the semi-final, Lewis admits to having &ldquo;dilemmas all over the pitch now we&rsquo;ve got a full squad, some class players such as Barrett, Riley and predatory striker Sneddon won&rsquo;t even make the squad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talking about the tournament as a whole, Lewis mentioned how he &ldquo;disliked the title of favourites as Alcuin are definitely favourites, but the players know we have a chance when we play our best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a farcical sub plot to today&rsquo;s action, Lewis was given the run around in the first half by Coupland but refused to admit that it was because Coupland was the better man. Instead he blamed his trainers, as his boots were falling apart and a nail was digging into his feet. My advice to Lewis would be to buy a pair of boots that are not from the 1950s.</p>

<p>Most people seem to think that Goodricke are favourites - Vision certainly does. I think that Adlou should be proud that Goodricke have the title of &#039;favourites&#039;. Good for them. Also, well done on an excellent result.</p>

<p>with Vision&#039;s in-depth knowledge of college football?Anyone who actually knows about college football says Alcuin are favourites, by winning the league two times in a row how can it be any other way?</p>

<p>Myles if we&#039;re to trust Vision then that makes you a goalkeeper...so i think we know it&#039;s not the best source of football knowledge. You only have to listen to the people that play college football. Alcuin are like the Germany of Euro 2008, I see us more of a Spain...</p>

<p>Yeh exactly that, we didn&#039;t win anything in the first 2 terms despite being expected to so although we&#039;ll be there or there abouts we&#039;re not considered favourites.</p>
<p>I do like the way you managed to fix the draw so that you don&#039;t meet us til the final though Myles. Very unorthodox tournament planning to say the least...</p>

<p>Oh Dominic, I think you&#039;ll find that it wasn&#039;t only me who oversaw the draw (which, unbelievably enough, certainly was not a &#039;fix&#039; as you so believe) but also a certain Mr Owen Grafham, former Goodricke captain.</p>
<p>&#039;Goodricke undoubtedly deserve their favourite tag&#039; - York Vision</p>

<p>I feel sorry for our 2s, they&#039;re a very solid team and would have been in with a good shout of making the semis if they&#039;d been drawn against anyone else.</p>
<p>On the matter of the draw, I heard that this is the same structure that they&#039;re using for the euros this summer?</p>
<p>Either way, it&#039;s a shame that the best two teams in the tournament are meeting in the semis.</p>

<p>I think Goodricke twos are a pretty mediocre seconds side who were in a poor group. Derwent, Alcuin, Vanbrugh, and Halifax all have better seconds teams, but were in harder groups. Goodricke 2nds would&#039;ve got eaten alive in any other group.</p>

<p>I highly doubt that #15- we may have been drawn in an easy group but I would have fancied our chances against any other 1sts team, mainly due to the fact that against Goodricke 1sts we could have no crossover players, thus limiting our team selection. Goodricke 2nds are a team who like to play football on the ground, rather than the hit and hope approach of many a 2nds team, and the astro suits us. No doubt in a college 2nds astro tournament, we would win.</p>

<p>A comprehensive loss to James 1sts, a lucky win against Derwent 3rds (Senchal offside), and an entirely lacklustre 0-0 draw against an awful Langwith side. Then found out entirely by Goodricke 1sts. Not exactly tournament winning form. Sneddon&#039;s tactics are farcical and they would have had no chance in any other group. Halifax and Vanbrugh clearly have the two best 2nd teams on astro. Don&#039;t believe me #16, organise a one day tournie for 2nds...</p>

<p>#16 has a point about not being able to use cross over players, as it weakened their side considerably. However when you say a comprehensive loss against James 1sts our 2nds also suffered a bad offside decision so that evens itself out with regards to the Senchal one. As for the Langwith game, despite them being one of the lesser ones they&#039;re still a 1st team and Goodricke 2s did enough against them to get through.</p>

<p>Goodricke 2nds are nowhere near a good 2nds side - Vanbrugh, Derwent, Halifax &amp; Alcuin are all a lot better.</p>
<p>As for the title of favourites, I think Goodricke benefit more than Alcuin from the inclusivity of all Uni 1sts players (being able to play Ramsden and O&#039;Shea rather than Henry Smith and Ed Murrils).</p>
<p>George Taylor&#039;s always worth a couple of goals to the other team though...</p>

<p>Thing is with Goodricke 2nds is that although there is some overlapping of players, mainly freshers, with the 1st team, unlike other colleges they will not use the most influential or &#039;best&#039; players from the 1st team in the big games as some blatantly do. It&#039;s crazy that some 1st team captains play for their 2nds too.</p>
<p>But you&#039;re right about george, always good for a mistake or two!</p>
