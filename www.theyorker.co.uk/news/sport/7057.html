        <p><strong>17:12</strong> Also a big thank you to Aimee Howarth, Harriet Evans, Mylo Scurr, Matt Cooke, Lucie Vincer, Michael Tansini, Bryony Holleran, Steve Puddicombe, Ben Bentley, Jamie Arden, Harriet Shaw, Miranda Smith, Ian Angell and Tsz-Chiu Tang for being really awesome Yorker Correspondents, and to Rich Crosby for all his technical genius!! Special and extra commendation to Lizzy Pennock and James Tompkinson for giving 100% of their time to liveblog ROSES 2011 this weekend! An amazing job guys!</p>
<p><strong>16:42</strong> So it&#039;s the end of Roses 2011 and the final scores stand at <strong>178.5</strong> for York and <strong>104.5</strong>. It&#039;s been tiring but fun, and thanks to everyone who helped out with live blogging. Goodnight!</p>
<p><strong>16:38</strong> <strong>Football Men&#039;s 1sts</strong>. YORK WIN! With a score of <strong>1-0</strong>&#039;, it&#039;s time to celebrate.</p>
<p><strong>16:35</strong> <strong>Football Men&#039;s 1sts</strong>. There&#039;s a penalty for York...it blazes over the bar but York still lead <strong>1-0</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>16:32</strong> <strong>Football Men&#039;s 1sts</strong>. Lancaster are down to 10 men now as York miss another great chance to kill the game off.</p>
<p><strong>16:28</strong> <strong>Football Men&#039;s 1sts</strong>. With 10 minutes to go, York are still leading. There&#039;s also just been a Lancastrian streaker on the pitch! What is it about those Lancastrian lads and getting naked?</p>
<p><strong>16:22</strong> <strong>Football Men&#039;s 1sts</strong>. A rifled shot from York hits the bar! Lancaster have a penalty but its saved by York. A great atmosphere here as York leads <strong>1 nil</strong></p>
<p><strong>16:16</strong> Great defending from York to keep Lancaster at bay as they keep their lead at <strong>1-0</strong> in <strong>Football Men&#039;s 1st</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>16:15</strong> </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/7552.jpg"><img src="../../photos/LiveblogImage/7552.jpg" height="250" width="620" title="Liveblog Images not found" alt="Liveblog Images not found"  /></a><br /></div>
<p> We&#039;re still waiting for the <strong>Football Men&#039;s 1sts</strong> results but here&#039;s a picture of some cute goslings while you wait!</p>
<p><strong>16:11</strong> It is near the end of Roses 2011 and York have officially <strong>won</strong>! With just <strong>Football Men&#039;s 1sts</strong> left, York is currently leading <strong>174.5-104.5</strong> overall! It&#039;s definitely time for celebrations!</p>
<p><strong>16:09</strong> <strong>Croquet</strong>. <strong>York Win</strong> as Brian Cantor seals it for the White Rose!</p>
<p><strong>16:09</strong> <strong>Football Men&#039;s 1sts</strong>. Goal to York ! Tap in at the back post and it&#039;s fully deserved !</p>
<p><strong>16:07</strong> </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/7551.jpg"><img src="../../photos/LiveblogImage/7551.jpg" height="250" width="620" title="Liveblog Images not found" alt="Liveblog Images not found"  /></a><br /></div>
<p> Scenes of civilisation over at the <strong>croquet</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>16:03</strong> <strong>Croquet</strong> One of Lancaster balls is nearing its last gate, while the other two trail a couple of gates behind.</p>
<p><strong>16:02</strong> </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/7550.jpg"><img src="../../photos/LiveblogImage/7550.jpg" height="250" width="620" title="Liveblog Images not found" alt="Liveblog Images not found"  /></a><br /></div>
<p> <strong>Women&#039;s Rugby</strong> earlier today</p>
<p><strong>16:02</strong> </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/7549.jpg"><img src="../../photos/LiveblogImage/7549.jpg" width="620" height="250" title="Football Men&#039;s 1sts" alt="Football Men&#039;s 1sts"  /></a><br /></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Football Men&#039;s 1sts</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:59</strong> <strong>Croquet</strong>. One of York&#039;s balls has completed its course. Lancaster is catching up though!</p>
<p><strong>15:58</strong> <strong>Football Men&#039;s 1sts</strong>. A group of 12 year olds have started chanting as York miss another great chance to take the lead.</p>
<p><strong>15:54</strong> <strong>Football Men&#039;s 1sts</strong> second half has just kicked off with York still looking dangerous! &quot;Get the ball down and use it!&quot; is the cry the York team&#039;s coach as York look for the opening goal!</p>
<p><strong>15:52</strong> <strong>Croquet</strong>. One of York&#039;s balls is miles ahead but the other three trail.</p>
<p><strong>15:51</strong> Lancaster won <strong>Intermediate</strong> and <strong>Advanced Trampolining</strong>, winning the event overall. York won Elite though! Class!</p>
<p><strong>15:47</strong> In <strong>Football Men&#039;s 1sts</strong>, the banter is flowing from the sidelines at this still <strong>0-0</strong> game!</p>
<p><strong>15:46</strong> Chaos at <strong>Croquet</strong> as one of the Lancaster players hits two balls in the water! Exciting!</p>
<p><strong>15:40</strong> In <strong>Croquet</strong>, Vice Chancellor of York Brian Cantor gets York&#039;s second ball through the first pin! Lancaster far behind!</p>
<p><strong>15:34</strong> <strong>Volleyball Mixed</strong>: YORK WIN! It&#039;s been a tense game, but with great shots and mistakes from both sides, York take the game <strong>15-13</strong> in the final set, winning <strong>3-2</strong> overall!</p>
<p><strong>15:33</strong> <strong>Football Men&#039;s 1sts</strong>: The ball has been kicked onto the golf course!</p>
<p><strong>15:33</strong> Matt Cooke is trying to have a stab at the rules of croquet, although its all a bit confusing for him as there are 6 players and 4 balls. Hmm...</p>
<p><strong>15:29</strong> <strong>Volleyball Mixed</strong>. York bring it back, now leading <strong>11-10</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>15:28</strong> <strong>Football Men&#039;s 1sts</strong>. Still <strong>0-0</strong> but York is growing in confidence, with good moves on the ball and pressing well out of possession!</p>
<p><strong>15:27</strong> Lancaster takes the lead in this final set <strong>6-3</strong> in <strong>Volleyball Mixed</strong>. Harriet is not happy.</p>
<p><strong>15:20</strong> <strong>Volleyball Mixed</strong>: Wow. Just Wow . York take the 4th set <strong>25-7</strong>. This is exciting stuff! All depends on the next and final set now! <strong>2-2</strong> in terms of sets currently. Go York!</p>
<p><strong>15:18</strong> <strong>Football Men&#039;s 1sts</strong>: Good chance for York as a shot from outside the area goes just over the bar. Still <strong>0-0</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>15:16</strong> Some amusing play from York No.6 and the York side look as though they are enjoying being in charge of this set, leading <strong>20-6</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>15:15</strong> Scrappy start to this half of <strong>Football Men&#039;s 1sts</strong> as both sides look to settle in, no real chance yet though!</p>
<p><strong>15:10</strong> York are playing better as a team in this set of <strong>Volleyball Mixed</strong>, but they have to keep it going to stop Lancaster from catching up! Currently <strong>9-4</strong> to York.</p>
<p><strong>15:06</strong> <strong>Football Men&#039;s 1sts</strong> have just started and York are looking good in the opening exchanges!</p>
<p><strong>15:05</strong> And now York are <strong>5-0</strong> up in <strong>Volleyball Mixed</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>15:04</strong> <strong>Volleyball Mixed</strong> If York can pull it together and win the 4th set they still have a chance. If they lose this one however, they lose the game. Resounding cheers as they take the <strong>1st</strong> point!</p>
<p><strong>15:01</strong> <strong>Volleyball Mixed</strong> Lancaster dominate third set, winning <strong>25-11</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>14:58</strong> In <strong>Volleyball Mixed</strong> Lancaster are still leading <strong>19-10</strong>, but it;s best of 5 so they need three sets to take the game. Far from over!</p>
<p><strong>14:51</strong> An ace shot from York No. 6 and it&#039;s <strong>5-5</strong> in the 3rd set of <strong>Volleyball Mixed</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>14:48</strong> And <strong>Lancaster win Netball 1sts 39-38</strong>! SO close! &quot;The closest of margins, the best of games&quot; Well deep Matt!</p>
<p><strong>14:46</strong> <strong>37-37</strong> in <strong>Netball 1sts</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>14:46</strong> In <strong>Volleyball Mixed</strong> Lancaster have taken the second set <strong>25-18</strong>  and York weren&#039;t looking too good at the end of that. That&#039;s 1 set so far. Let&#039;s hope York can combat Lancaster&#039;s tactic!</p>
<p><strong>14:45</strong> York wins both the <strong>Men&#039;s Canoe Slalom</strong> and the <strong>Women&#039;s Canoe Slalom</strong> 2-0 so that&#039;s four more Roses points to York.</p>

<p><strong>14:37</strong> 13-13 in the <strong>mixed volleyball</strong>, and Harriet is raving about the skills of York&#039;s number 4, who by all accounts is playing very well!</p>
<p><strong>14:36</strong> Lancaster square the <strong>netball</strong> and it&#039;s 30-30 now. Tense times for the girls now, they need to show composure and keep cool heads to see this home.</p>
<p><strong>14:35</strong> Big result from Fortress 22 acres as York take the <strong>men&#039;s seconds football</strong> 3-2. Great work lads, a wonderful second half turnaround! 2 more points for York!</p>
<p><strong>14:33</strong> Harriet is getting a little annoyed with York&#039;s post point winning chant in the <strong>volleyball</strong>. York lead 11-8 in the second set now.</p>
<p><strong>14:31</strong> Matt Cooke reports that the third quarter in the <strong>netball</strong> ends 29-26 to York. One more quarter to go, come on girls!</p>

<p><strong>14:06</strong> York trail in the <strong>Women&#039;s football</strong> by a goal to nil. Come on girls, sort this game out!</p>
<p><strong>14:05</strong> <strong>Mixed Volleyball</strong> is under way, and Harriet Evans tells me that YSTV are down there filming. Wouldn&#039;t want to make a mistake in front of the cameras if I was playing!</p>
<p><strong>13:58</strong> Oh big moment in the <strong>Men&#039;s Football 2nds</strong> as York equalise!! I said that the next goal would be important, and York have got it! Now, carry the momentum on and go and win the game boys!</p>
<p><strong>13:57</strong> Lizzy informs me that the judges are all sat cross-legged in the corner as they calculate their results! She loves the informality of it all!</p>
<p><strong>13:55</strong> York&#039;s dancers have done all they can now as we wait on the results. In Lizzy&#039;s opinion, York have a very strong chance of winning!</p>
<p><strong>13:54</strong> And it&#039;s half time in the <strong>Men&#039;s Second&#039;s Football</strong> with York trailing 2-1</p>
<p><strong>13:53</strong> York lead 11-7 in the <strong>netball</strong> at the end of the first quarter. Good work girls, got to keep that going now!</p>

<p><strong>13:51</strong> And Lancaster take the lead in the <strong>Women&#039;s Football</strong>. Bad times...</p>
<p><strong>13:50</strong> Lizzy tells me that she is &quot;loving&quot; the <strong>street dancing</strong> and that York seem to have had the most interesting choreography so far!</p>
<p><strong>13:47</strong> Lancaster&#039;s street dancers are looking sharp with an interesting mash up of songs and moves, but York street dancers are no less impressive dressed as mimes!</p>
<p><strong>13:47</strong> Lancaster equalise <strong>7-7</strong> in <strong>Netball 1sts</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>13:45</strong> <strong>Volleyball Mixed</strong> teams are just warming up in the Main Hall now!</p>
<p><strong>13:44</strong> In <strong>Netball 1sts</strong> York take the early lead <strong>7-2</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>13:41</strong> York still trail in the <strong>Men&#039;s Second&#039;s Football</strong> by two goals to one. It&#039;s a scrappy game out there and York need to get their foot on the ball and start stringing more passes together with a little more authority and composure if they are to win the match.</p>
<p><strong>13:39</strong> We&#039;re back under way in the <strong>trampolining</strong> after a break due to a Lancaster injuy. Good work from Steph out there who is keeping me nicely informed!</p>
<p><strong>13:37</strong> YUSU president Tim Ngwena is getting involved at the <strong>dancing</strong> and we are informed by Lizzy that he has said that the dancing will be worth points next year as it has been so well received by the crowds this year.</p>
<p><strong>13:34</strong> Lizzy reports that York are doing really well in the <strong>dancing</strong> and combining slick choreography with stylish lifts.</p>

<p>York do us proud in <strong>netball</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>13:30</strong> Lancaster pulling things round in the <strong>men&#039;s seconds football</strong> as they now lead <strong>2-1</strong>. Big effort needed on 22 acres now from the York lads, and the next goal in that game will be absolutely crucial.</p>
<p><strong>13:28</strong> Lancaster are <strong>tap dancing</strong> now as Lizzy reports that there are &quot;bright tights and neck chiefs&quot; on show. Gnarls Barkley&#039;s &quot;smiling&quot; is on as background music, although I&#039;m not sure how much longer Lancaster will be smiling because the Carter-James Cup is coming home to York, and in some style too!</p>
<p><strong>13:22</strong> Lancaster battle to the end in and win <strong>64-55</strong> in <strong>Basketball Men&#039;s 1sts</strong> . A great game from both sides, and <strong>4</strong> points to Lancaster!</p>
<p><strong>13:22</strong> Fantastic atmosphere down on 22 acres this morning as York start to enter party mode!

<p>A peek at yesterday&#039;s <strong>Snowboarding</strong> event at Sheffield Ski Village!</p>
<p><strong>10:25</strong> <strong>Netball 3rds</strong>. York are fighting back with <strong>8-8</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>10:25</strong> <strong>Women&#039;s Basketball 1sts</strong>. York increase their lead with a score of <strong>22-9</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>10:20</strong> <strong>Women&#039;s Basketball 1sts</strong>. With some fantastic moves from the York team, they lead <strong>18-6</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>10:20</strong> According to the bloke in charge of the <strong>archery</strong>, Lancaster have already taken one point this morning, but we won&#039;t know the rest of the scores until much later on. I decided to come back into the warmth, only to miss the end of breakfast service in V-Bar! Very bad times!</p>
<p><strong>10:19</strong> <strong>Netball 3rds</strong>. <strong>7-5</strong> to Lancaster after the first quarter.</p>
<p><strong>10:15</strong> With cheerleaders at <strong>Women&#039;s Basketball 1sts</strong> the Lancaster lads are certainly being kept happy...</p>
<p><strong>10:14</strong> <strong>Women&#039;s Basketball 1sts</strong>. #5 and #14 look particularly bright for York. By the end of the 1st quarter it&#039;s <strong>14-6</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>10:12</strong> <strong>Women&#039;s Basketball 1sts</strong>. York lead <strong>10-6</strong> with good play and good pulling away.</p>
<p><strong>10:08</strong> <strong>Women&#039;s Basketball 1sts</strong>. With some good quick attacking from York, the score is level at <strong>6-6</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>10:07</strong> </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/7532.jpg"><img src="../../photos/LiveblogImage/7532.jpg" width="620" height="250" title="Lacrosse drinking" alt="Lacrosse drinking"  /></a><br /></div>
<p> The <strong>Lacrosse</strong> girls use an interesting drinking apparatus after yesterday&#039;s winning game.</p>
<p><strong>10:04</strong> <strong>Women&#039;s Basketball 1sts</strong>. Both sides are missing the hoop but Lancaster takes the lead with <strong>6-4</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>10:01</strong> <strong>Women&#039;s Basketball 1sts</strong>. It&#039;s <strong>2 all</strong> so far.</p>
<p><strong>10:00</strong> Still waiting for a start in the archery but our Sports Editor James Tompkinson doesn&#039;t like the look of the bows. Lethal! Don&#039;t get hit James...</p>
<p><strong>09:54</strong> The smell of bacon and eggs down at V Bar is making us hungry, an orange is poor substitute.</p>
<p><strong>09:51</strong> Our News Editor Aimee Howarth is down at <strong>Women&#039;s Basketball 1sts</strong> where they are stretching and warming up. She&#039;s glad to be inside out of the cold!</p>
<p><strong>09:39</strong> James Tompkinson is now on his way to watch some <strong>archery</strong>. Will Roses be won there?</p>
<p><strong>09:29</strong> Lots of sport still left to be played on Roses Sunday. We have <strong>archery, hockey, judo, rugby sevens, netball, cycling, basketball</strong> and lots of <strong>football</strong></p>
<p><strong>09:20</strong> It has to be said that yesterday was a very good day for York. They dominated their counterparts from Lancaster and we fully expect the White Rose to finish the job today and win Roses 2011. It would take a brave man to bet against them, the job still needs to be done, and York will want to maintain a degree of professionalism all through today and try and make this as comprehensive as possible!</p>
<p><strong>08:56</strong> We are also starting the day with York over 60 points in the lead so whatever happens, this will be an exciting day!</p>
<p><strong>08:55</strong> Good morning York and Lancaster University! It&#039;s 5 to 9 and we are positively raring (well, not positively raring, but with several, or many cups of coffee I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll get there!) to kick off the third and final day of Roses 2011! Stay with us!</p>
