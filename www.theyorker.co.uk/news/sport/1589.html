		<div class="SubText">Well it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s finally festival time, the endless agony of waiting is so nearly over. My gift to you? I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m going to share my secret. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m going to let you see my workings, how I have earned a profit for all my loyal followers. The system? I back the best horses, at the best prices. 
</div>

        

<h3> 2.00 - The Supreme Novices&rsquo; Hurdle </h3>

<p><strong>GTT:</strong> Last time out <strong>Pigeon Island</strong> lugged 11-9 to an impressive 5 length victory, which represents very solid form. However, that race rarely makes an impact at the festival, which is why he is available at 12/1 in places. This looks cracking value based on that effort, as I rate him at least an 8/1 shot. His new waiting style will suit this cavalry charge, he&rsquo;ll love the conditions and Paddy Brennan definitely has the nous to get him home.</p>
<p>Elsewhere <strong>Binocular</strong> has done nothing wrong, and looks a fair price. This one has the profile for this event, after an impressive odds on victory over Pierrot Lunaire. However, he is only 4, and his form is very bare. My worry is that this will all happen too quickly for him, and he could easily be out-muscled. However, he could be something special, so have a small stake saver.</p>
<p>The last price that looks tempting is the 25/1 being offered about <strong>Tranquil Sea</strong>. &frac34; of a length behind Cork All Star last time he does have a bit to find, but that form reads very well. Have a nibble at the 7.8 about him making the frame.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Pigeon Island</strong> 2pts each way (12/1 VC Bet) <em>NAP</em>

</li><li><strong>Tranquil Sea</strong> 1pt to be placed (7.8 Betfair)

</li><li><strong>Binocular</strong> 1pt to win (9 Bet Fred)
</li></ul>


<h3> 2.35 &ndash; Independent Arkle Challenge Trophy Chase </h3>

<p><strong>GTT:</strong> Noland attracts all the attention here, and seems to be another Nicholls&rsquo; hotshot. His price, currently 2/1, is a reflection of this. However, despite a flawless record, he does have a bit to find with a lot of these and there is nothing tempting in that price at all.</p>
<p>The second favourite here is Tidal Bay, and deservedly so. Unfortunately he is prone to a blunder, and there are doubts about whether this is really his trip. Similar doubts surround Thyne Again, but conditions look right for Mahogany Blaze. My fear for this one is that he&rsquo;ll again expend his energy chasing the front runners though.</p>
<p><strong>Kruguyrova</strong> has been in the front two in every one of her last 7 starts, and receives a handy weight allowance. The best rider in the business is on board, and the last time these two paired up the selection won by 22 lengths. Take her each way though, as her form seems below normal Arkle standard. French Accordion is an interesting one, but after 100 days off the track since a worrying effort, is best watched. Moon over Miami seems to like it soft now, and doesn&rsquo;t seem to be put together well enough to take this.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Kruguyrova</strong> 1pt each way (14/1 widely available)
</li></ul>


<h3> 3.15 - The Champion Hurdle </h3>

<p><strong>Sneer:</strong> My advice is not to look too far out of the front three in the betting.  Sublimity will hope to be able to emulate greats such as Istabraq and Hardy Eustace and retain the Champion Hurdle.  Sublimity has only had one runout this season and he finished a disappointing 18 lengths behind <strong>Osana</strong> that day.  His trainer says he was only 85% fit however, and both Carberry and Carr are still very optimistic about his chances.</p>
<p>Osana is the horse with the best chance in this one.  In December he was an impressive 8 lengths clear in the Boylesports.com International Hurdle, with four of todays competitors behind him.  There is a slight danger that he won&#039;t run his race if he isn&#039;t able to dictate the pace, but jockey Tom Scudamore will get him to the front early to avoid such complications..  The only one who looks to have the better of him is Sizing Europe.</p>
<p>Sizing Europe was finished 4 lengths ahead of Osana at Cheltenham in November but the favourite will be 6lbs worse off today.  Like Osana, Sizing Europe has also won impressively since the two met.  I just think that the company Osana had to defeat was of a slightly higher standard and he looks to be well in at the weights.</p>
<p><strong>Katchit</strong> is another horse to look out for.  His form this season hasn&#039;t quite lived up to the promise of last year, but has every chance to feature today at a course that seems made for him.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Osana</strong> 2pts (5/1 on paddypower.com - who will refund your stake if your horse finishes 2nd to the SP favourite) NAP

</li><li><strong>Katchit</strong> 1pt each way (10/1 on paddypower.com)
</li></ul>


<h3> 4.00 - William Hill Trophy Handicap </h3>

<p></p>
<div style="float: left; width: 180px; padding: 2px"><a href="../../photos/full/685.jpg"><img src="../../photos/medium/685.jpg" width="180" height="145" title="Sneer" alt="Sneer"  /></a><div>Sneer will be posting his analysis all week</div></div>
<p>
<strong>Sneer:</strong> A favourite&#039;s graveyard.  None of the leading fancies have won this in the last ten years and I think today will be no exception.  An Accordion beat Ungaro in January in his first run with blinkers.  If he can repeat that he will have a chance, but I believe his previous form was too erratic.  Blinkers can sharpen a horse but will not guarantee consistency.</p>
<p><strong>Orafel D&#039; Airy</strong> is another whose last run went surprisingly well with the introduction of blinkers.  Factor in the 7lbs he gains on Fundamentalist and that could be just enough to reverse the 19 lengths he needs to find with that horse.  The difference is that Orafel D&#039; Airy&#039;s win came over hurdles and so he is rated 3lbs lower than his last chasing start. whilst An Accordion is 11lbs higher.</p>
<p>Monkerhostin is well in here and his performances at Cheltenham could see him feature.  Avoid Abragante and New Alco who have not lived up to the hype surrounding them this season.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Orafel D&#039; Airy</strong> 1pt (18.5 on Betfair)
</li></ul>


<h3> 4.40 - BCG Cross Country Handicap Chase </h3>

<p><strong>Sneer:</strong> Despite shouldering top weight I fancy <strong>Heads Onthe Ground</strong> to take this one.  Trainer Enda Bolger was also the mastermind behind Spot Thedifference&#039;s seven Cross Country victories in his career.  Heads Onthe Ground won the race last year and must overcome the weight rise since then.  Wonderkid beat him at the Cross Country Chase in December but is now 11lbs worse off with Bolger&#039;s horse.</p>
<p>Garde Champetre is very well in with Heads Onthe Ground. being 5lbs lighter than when beating him in Punchestown in February.  I think Heads Onthe Ground will overcome that since the heavy ground that day did not suit him.  Never Compromise is also well in but is unproven over this distance, which is a huge worry for a gruelling Cross Country race.</p>
<p><strong>Royal Auclair</strong> and Ivoire De Beaulieu are another two that look good at the weigths considering Wonderkid&#039;s hike.  Preference for either of these to place is for Royal Auclair, whose form since the loss to Wonderkid has been to finish inside the front three twice.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Heads Onthe Ground</strong> 1 pt (11/2 on Sportingbet.com)

</li><li><strong>Royal Auclair</strong> each way 0.5pts each way (14/1 on bet365.com)
</li></ul>


<h3> 5.20 &ndash; Juvenile Novices&rsquo; Handicap Hurdle </h3>

<p><strong>GTT:</strong> Best to take a long price in this competitive handicap. With the front two too short in the market, 5/2 and 7/2, they simply can&rsquo;t appeal in a race so competitive. <strong>Zanir</strong> comes here on the up and with conditions to suit, Callisto Moon has some handy form, but the rain might have ruined his chances. Bayonyx would want it firmer, while Silmi has a lot to do to turn things around with Ashkazar.</p>

<ul><li>1pt win <strong>Zanir</strong> (60s on Betfair)

</li><li>1pt place <strong>Zanir</strong> (9.4 on Betfair)
</li></ul>
