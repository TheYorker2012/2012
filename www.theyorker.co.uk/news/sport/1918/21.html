		</div>
		<div class="SubText">If any game was unworthy of it&#039;s scoreline, it was this one. Vanbrugh were valiant throughout and were defeated more by luck than a shortage of ability. It was two fortuitous goals shortly before half time that put paid to Vanbrugh&#039;s chances of progressing in the tournament.</div>

        <p><strong>Halifax 1sts  - 4</strong></p>
<p>Corstjens OG 24,
Fortnam 26,
McKellow 40 &amp; 50</p>
<p><strong>Vanbrugh 2nds - 1</strong></p>
<p>Buckley 53</p>
<p>The game attracted a meagre turnout, mostly thanks to the deluge. However, those who were brave enough to confront the elements were rewarded with a highly entertaining, competitive fixture.</p>
<p>The game&rsquo;s early exchanges were tentative however, with Oomen blazing the first chance over the bar in the fifth minute. However, despite this early opportunity for Halifax it was the well organised Vanbrugh who were to exert themselves on the game. Corstjens provided a touch of quality in Vanbrugh&rsquo;s midfield when using his quick feet to find Ridgeway, who put a high ball in, but Buckley couldn&rsquo;t get any power behind his header.</p>
<p>The first half was played mostly in Halifax&rsquo;s half, so even though Brennan and Fahey were linking up well, they couldn&rsquo;t pose any threat on Vanbrugh&rsquo;s goal from so deep.</p>
<p>Corstjens and Nightingale were involved in an absorbing midfield battle, before one Nightingale tackle in the fifteenth minute cleared the ball to Vanbrugh centre-back Whittaker. Whittaker lumped the ball forward as all solid college second team centre-backs know how to do. Patel was unable to come and claim the ball at the first attempt in the slippy conditions, dropping the ball at Regan&rsquo;s feet. With Regan sure to break the deadlock, inspirational third year Broadhurst showed a distressing disregard for his own safety when throwing himself in front of the ball preventing a certain goal.</p>
<p>Ten minutes of Vanbrugh pressure followed, but that would prove be their best chance of the first half.</p>
<p>Class act Corstjens was to turn from hero to villain five minutes before half time. Fahey whipped in a low bending cross which ricocheted off the unlucky midfielder, beating Henderson at the front post. Vanbrugh responded instantly when Buckley hit a dangerous cross which Evans managed to scramble away at the back post. The next attacking move presented Corstjens with the chance to make quick amends, but the bouncing ball just spun away from the midfielder when he looked to unleash a vicious volley.</p>
<p>McKellow had started slowly, but was beginning to have an impression on the game. Bringing the ball down coolly on the half way line he found Fortnam who charged down Shultz&rsquo;s clearance to leave himself in acres of space, with only the &lsquo;keeper to beat.  A cool finish rounded off two goals in two minutes for Halifax right at the end of the first half, a lead which they didn&rsquo;t deserve.</p>
<p>Halifax captain Fahey agreed that they were lucky to be leading at half time, saying &ldquo;We played the football but the goals we scored were lucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>

</div></blockquote><p>Vanbrugh made three changes in an attempt to turn things around in the second half and, after a limp free kick from McKellow, the Vanbrugh skipper missed a gilt-edged chance when blazing the ball over the bar from no more than six yards. Just three minutes later, when Corstjens brought down Nightingale outside the box, McKellow was handed another opportunity from a free kick. He put his previous attempt behind him with a scorching strike, which shot like a bullet into the top left corner of the goal.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>As the game opened up McKellow and Brennan began to show their class. Green put in some good work down the left wing, crossing for McKellow to tap in at close range - putting the tie to bed.</p>
<p>Vanbrugh, to their credit, kept battling on. Hewitt&rsquo;s delivery was a constant danger, including one audacious shot from his own half, which Patel was forced to push out for a corner. Shortly after another Whittaker hoof caused more havoc in the Halifax area, earning a corner this time. From this corner Buckley scored a powerful header to give Vanbrugh the goal that was the least their play had deserved.</p>
<p>As the game entered it&rsquo;s final stages Vanbrugh kept the pressure on, pinning &lsquo;the Fax&rsquo; deep into their own penalty area, peppering them with shots. Whittaker had the best late chance, when the ball looped over his shoulder offering the opportunity to volley. Unfortunately however the centre-back couldn&rsquo;t make contact with the ball which limped weakly out of play.</p>
<p>After their first defeat of the tournament, Vanbrugh seconds captain Ollie Regan said, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re a good side, two of their goals were pretty lucky I&rsquo;ve got to be honest. They deserved two of them, 2-1 was probably a fair score I&rsquo;d say, not 4-1.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we got the goal because we definitely deserved that. The team have been really good, they&rsquo;ve played well all tournament, and all year, it&rsquo;s been fantastic. We&rsquo;re the best second team this year.</p>

</div></blockquote><p>&ldquo;It was a really good performance. We did really well, and you couldn&rsquo;t ask for any more. I&rsquo;m happy because we played really well, at least we went out playing well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is certainly entitled to be proud of his team, they performed exceptionally well and really challenged a team filled with university standard performers. They will rue two missed opportunities that could have swung the game their way, the Broadhurst clearance, and Regan&rsquo;s volley early in the second half; but it wasn&rsquo;t to be. Instead Halifax booked their place in the Semis, where they&rsquo;ll meet the highly touted Alcuin 1sts.</p>
<p></p>

<br /><span class="author">Oli Fahey</span>
</div></blockquote><p>Victorious skipper Oli Fahey was understandably bullish about his side&rsquo;s chances after this emphatic victory, &ldquo;We perform better against first teams, because we get more up for it. Complacency sets in when we play the second teams and it did today. I think we&rsquo;ll start stronger against the first teams. We&rsquo;ve got a good chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked if he thought Alcuin would be there for the taking after scraping through on penalties against Derwent, Fahey replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say so. Goodricke, Alcuin and Halifax are three top teams. Either one of them could win it. If you look at the league standings in the spring term then obviously Alcuin were at the top, but anyone can come through and win it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Teams</strong></p>
<p><strong>Halifax</strong>, <strong>3-5-2</strong>, Patel, Evans, Rixon, Broadhurst, Oomen, McKellow, Nightingale, Brennan, Fahey (c) , Fortnam, Green. SUBS: Omarov, Clarke.</p>
<p><strong>Vanbrugh</strong>, <strong>4-1-4-1</strong>, Ridgeway, Shultz, Whittaker, Hewitt, Waterson, L. Regan, Corstjens, Weavis, O. Regan (c), Buckley. SUBS: Lewis, Williams, Carr.</p>
<p><span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>&rsquo;s <em>Man of the Match</em> &ndash; <strong>Ian McKellow</strong>. Astroturf often sorts the men from the boys, and Ian stood tall today with a commanding performance in the centre of the park.  His superb touch helped set up the second goal, a brilliant strike from a free kick made it three, before he found space to tap home for Halifax&rsquo;s fourth.</p>
