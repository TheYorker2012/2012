        <p><strong>16:38</strong> So, that&#039;s it from me. I hope you all enjoyed Varsity 2011. Well done York!</p>
<p><strong>16:36</strong> If you have missed any of the weekend&#039;s action, <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> will have a summary up tonight!</p>
<p><strong>16:36</strong> Don&#039;t forget about the trophy presentation later! Get down to L/N/028 from 6pm and there will be a special performance from Capoeira before the trophy is presented. Don&#039;t miss it - there&#039;s free food and drinks too!</p>
<p><strong>16:35</strong> YORK 60-25 HULL</p>
<p><strong>16:35</strong> So four more points to Hull and then ends the day&#039;s, and the weekend&#039;s, action. Thanks for reading the blog everyone!</p>
<p><strong>16:35</strong> News from the ten-pin bowling is that Hull have beaten York with a mammoth score of 6794-6412. They have been playing since 11am this morning. Well done them!</p>
<p><strong>16:34</strong> So, that&#039;s all for today! The score overall is 60-21 to York, who have been impressive throughout the whole weekend.</p>
<p><strong>16:33</strong> All the ultimate frisbee is all over. Hull win 13-7, despite a valiant comeback late on from York. They take the four points.</p>
<p><strong>16:27</strong> Hull score in the ultimate frisbee, making it 12-7. They only need one more point for the win.</p>
<p><strong>16:26</strong> James Tompkinson speaks to Sam Asfahani, who says the weekend &quot;has been a great success&quot; and is especially pleased about the American Football victory (not part of Varsity!).</p>
<p><strong>16:24</strong> York have pulled the score back from 11-4 down to 11-7 down. It&#039;s so close and Matt Cooke says you can see the tension in everyone&#039;s faces down at 22 acres.</p>
<p><strong>16:23</strong> And York keep scoring in the ultimate frisbee! It&#039;s now 11-7. It&#039;s first to 13 wins, remember.</p>
<p><strong>16:18</strong> York score again, making it 11-6 to Hull in the ultimate frisbee. Is there a dramatic fightback on the cards?</p>
<p><strong>16:17</strong> So, to summarise the day, there were huge wins in the tennis for York, seeing them take 7 points, followed by impressive wins in the men&#039;s football for another 7 points. Badminton emulated this, winning their fixtures easily. There were wins for Hull in the ultimate frisbee and basketball, giving them 8 points.</p>
<p><strong>16:14</strong> Slight encouragement for York as they get the score in the ultimate frisbee to 11-5 thanks to a brilliant score from 40 yards but is it too little too late?</p>
<p><strong>16:08</strong> Hull lead 11-4 in the ultimate frisbee and are in the two point cap. That means the first to 13 wins. My bet&#039;s on Hull.</p>
<p><strong>16:02</strong> That puts the overall score at 60-17 in York&#039;s favour. Can Hull get the four points in the ultimate frisbee to make sure they beat York St John&#039;s score?</p>
<p><strong>16:01</strong> It&#039;s all over in the men&#039;s firsts football and York have a 2-0 victory, thanks to two first-half goals. Four more points in the bag.</p>
<p><strong>15:59</strong> Hull increase their lead in the ultimate frisbee and now lead 10-4 and it looks like they will be taking the four points.</p>
<p><strong>15:56</strong> York still trail 3-8 in the ultimate frisbee and have a player down hurt. Not the most successful afternoon for the ultimate squad.</p>
<p><strong>15:55</strong> Reporter Matt Cooke just bumped into Sports President Sam Asfahani, who told him that the York American Football team, the Centurions, won their game against Lancaster 3-2. Ah the joys of beating bitter rivals.</p>
<p><strong>15:53</strong> Oh and let&#039;s not forget 10-pin bowling! That took place at York Megabowl and we&#039;re waiting for the scores to come in.</p>
<p><strong>15:52</strong> Just waiting for the results of the men&#039;s firsts football and the ultimate frisbee now to round of what has been a fantastic weekend of sport.</p>
<p><strong>15:51</strong> And it does indeed finish 8-0 to York in the men&#039;s firsts badminton, giving York four more points. Fantastic performances from the badminton players.</p>
<p><strong>15:46</strong> Don&#039;t forget about the trophy presentation later! Get down to L/N/028 from 6pm and there will be a special performance from Capoeira before the trophy is presented. Don&#039;t miss it - there&#039;s free food and drinks too!</p>
<p><strong>15:44</strong> The men&#039;s firsts badminton is currently 7-0 to York, with one game to play. Will it be a whitewash? That will be four more points to York.</p>
<p><strong>15:42</strong> The firsts football remains 2-0 to York as the clock ticks down. Not long left now though and surely a victory for York.</p>
<p><strong>15:37</strong> Seven points from the men&#039;s tennis means York now lead 52-17 overall. An impressive weekend from all York&#039;s teams.</p>
<p><strong>15:35</strong> The tennis seconds finishes 8-4 to York, securing three more points.</p>
<p><strong>15:33</strong> York&#039;s badminton firsts lead 6-0 and gain four more points with the win secured with only two more games to play there.</p>
<p><strong>15:31</strong> Matt Cooke reports that the tennis seconds won 10-2 and the firsts are 8-2 up, with one game just finishing 6-1, 6-0, and the last game just being played.</p>
<p><strong>15:29</strong> Hull increase their lead in the ultimate frisbee and it&#039;s now 8-2 at half-time. Can York turn it around?</p>
<p><strong>15:28</strong> York lose two games in the tennis firsts but have won overall already. More from Matt Cooke soon.</p>
<p><strong>15:25</strong> It&#039;s full time in the basketball and Hull win 101-59, impressively outplaying York. That gives them four more points but puts them on a total of 17. Almost up to York St John&#039;s total of 19.25 from last year.</p>
<p><strong>15:21</strong> James Tompkinson reports that the football firsts&#039; game has gone very scrappy now. York still lead 2-0 though in the second half.</p>
<p><strong>15:18</strong> So, a reminder (as if you&#039;d forget) that York have won Varsity and the score overall is currently 45-13.</p>
<p><strong>15:12</strong> Hull increase their lead in the basketball to 86-43, with only the last quarter to play.</p>
<p><strong>15:09</strong> Hull increase their lead in the ultimate frisbee to 6-2 and look like getting their second win of the day.</p>
<p><strong>15:08</strong> It&#039;s half time in the men&#039;s firsts football and York lead 2-0. James Tompkinson reports that York are dominating the game and should be further ahead.</p>
<p><strong>15:02</strong> Hull are on top in the ultimate frisbee and lead 4-1. York are struggling to find a way back into it.</p>
<p><strong>15:01</strong> York pull back a few in the men&#039;s firsts basketball but are 32-70 down so it looks like game over.</p>
<p><strong>14:57</strong> Hull impress in the basketball and lead 60-25. York are struggling to keep up now.</p>
<p><strong>14:55</strong> There&#039;s a lot going on at the moment: York are behind in the basketball and ultimate frisbee but ahead in the first&#039;s football, badminton and tennis. Still a lot of points available, even though York have won.</p>
<p><strong>14:53</strong> And Hull&#039;s lead has just been increased in the ultimate frisbee. 3-1 now.</p>
<p><strong>14:48</strong> Hull have turned the ultimate frisbee around and now lead 2-1 after trailing 1-0.</p>
<p><strong>14:47</strong> At the end of the second quarter in the basketball, Hull have build on their lead and are ahead 42-16.</p>
<p><strong>14:46</strong> James Tompkinson reports merriment and drama down at the football as a spectator is cautioned, followed soon after by York missing an open goal.</p>
<p><strong>14:45</strong> The second ultimate frisbee game of the day starts, this time outside, not in. York will be looking for revenge for their earlier 8-3 loss and currently lead 1-0.</p>
<p><strong>14:44</strong> York&#039;s men&#039;s tennis first team have secured victory in their fixture.</p>
<p><strong>14:43</strong> Hull are currently on 13 points. That&#039;s fewer points than York St John managed last year - 19.25.</p>
<p><strong>14:41</strong> So, now York has won Varsity, we can look forward to the trophy presentation. It will take place in L/N/028 from 6pm and there will be a special performance from Capoeira before the trophy is presented. Don&#039;t miss it - there&#039;s free food and drinks too!</p>
<p><strong>14:34</strong> York football firsts double their advantage over Hull and are bossing the game. It&#039;s 2-0 already.</p>
<p><strong>14:31</strong> There&#039;s a victory in the tennis singles for the seconds, 6-0 6-0. That puts them up 6-0 overall and secures the points.</p>
<p><strong>14:29</strong> The men&#039;s football firsts are up 1-0 already in their game. Looks like another successful afternoon for York&#039;s footballers, following the women&#039;s and Medics&#039; seconds victories yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>14:27</strong> It&#039;s the end of the first quarter in the men&#039;s firsts basketball and Hull narrowly lead 13-6.</p>
<p><strong>14:26</strong> Don&#039;t worry if you have missed any of the weekend&#039;s action - <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> will have a summary of the weekend up tonight!</p>
<p><strong>14:23</strong> Hull take an early early in the men&#039;s firsts basketball and are up 9-4. Plenty of time for a York come-back though.</p>
<p><strong>14:21</strong> So overall it&#039;s currently 45-13 to York, which means, with only 26 points remaining, YORK HAVE WON VARSITY!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>14:20</strong> And the whistle has blown at the second&#039;s football. It finishes 4-1 to York and that&#039;s three points to York.</p>
<p><strong>14:13</strong> Coming up this afternoon we still have basketball, men&#039;s firsts football, badminton and ultimate frisbee, so don&#039;t go anywhere. Unless you&#039;re going down to the sports centre to cheer York on!</p>
<p><strong>14:08</strong> Good news from Matt Cooke down at the tennis - the players are back on the courts and play will resume shortly.</p>
<p><strong>14:05</strong> The football seconds are dominating now and have scored yet again. They lead 4-1.</p>
<p><strong>14:05</strong> The men&#039;s firsts football will be starting shortly and hopefully they&#039;ll be as successful as the seconds, although the rain isn&#039;t doing any favours for the pitches.</p>
<p><strong>14:00</strong> York have scored in the seconds football to make it 3-1. Surely that&#039;s the win sealed with less than ten minutes to play.</p>
<p><strong>13:54</strong> There are chances at both ends in the seconds football but York hold onto their 2-1 lead, with 15 minutes still to play.</p>
<p><strong>13:47</strong> Bad news from the tennis courts - play has been suspended due to rain. Everyone is dashing for shelter.</p>
<p><strong>13:47</strong> All quiet down at the football as the clock ticks down. York still has a 2-1 lead. Will this ensure them the points needed to win Varsity?!</p>
<p><strong>13:45</strong> Just a reminder that York lead Hull 42-13 overall and only need one more point to secure Varsity victory!</p>
<p><strong>13:42</strong> There&#039;s a lot of victories in the tennis for York and I&#039;m struggling to keep up! Overall it&#039;s 2-0 to York in the men&#039;s firsts and 5-0 to York in the men&#039;s seconds. Both teams play ten games in total, meaning the seconds have secured at least a draw.</p>
<p><strong>13:41</strong> Speaking of football, the Carling Cup final between Arsenal and Birmingham kicks off at 4pm. But we&#039;d much rather be at Varsity, wouldn&#039;t we?!</p>
<p><strong>13:38</strong> There are also wins in the tennis in the two doubles games. York in control down on the courts.</p>
<p><strong>13:37</strong> In the tennis, York&#039;s Tom Freeman wins 6-3, 7-5. He was 5-0 up in the second set and just managed to hold off the Hull fight-back. He was heard afterwards saying &quot;I need a beer!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>13:34</strong> York take the lead (again) in the men&#039;s seconds football and are 2-1 up. Let&#039;s hope they can keep it this time.</p>
<p><strong>13:31</strong> It&#039;s half-time in the men&#039;s seconds football and it&#039;s still 1-1. James Tompkinson reports that York are much better in possession but are struggling defensively.</p>
<p><strong>13:28</strong> Correction: Hull&#039;s Superheroes have lost 6-3, 6-4 in the tennis.</p>
<p><strong>13:25</strong> The badminton victory gives York three more points. It&#039;s 42-13 overall and that means, with 29 points remaining, if York lost everything else, it would finish a draw.</p>
<p><strong>13:23</strong> York&#039;s Tim Robson wins the final badminton match 22-20, 21-16 and so York win the fixture 7-1 overall. Very impressive from the badminton squad.</p>
<p><strong>13:21</strong> Hull equalise in the men&#039;s seconds football. 1-1, but not half-time yet so this could go either way.</p>
<p><strong>13:20</strong> In more tennis, Hull&#039;s Superheroes are 6-3, 6-4 down. Perhaps there will be a surprise comeback yet though.</p>
<p><strong>13:19</strong> In the tennis, singles player Jonny Tate wins 6-0, 6-1 for York. Apparently he said &quot;this is the second best moment of my life, after I saw a badger fight a hedgehog.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>13:16</strong> Tim Robson is playing the last badminton match for the seconds and York have already sealed the points and are currently 6-1 up.</p>
<p><strong>13:11</strong> So, a reminder of the day&#039;s action so far: badminton was cancelled this morning due to Hull not fielding a team and then Hull took the first points of the day with a win in ultimate frisbee, adding four to their total.</p>
<p><strong>13:07</strong> York take the lead in the seconds football and it&#039;s 1-0.</p>
<p><strong>13:06</strong> York are doing well in the tennis singles - they are one set up in one match and have just won the first set 6-0 the other.</p>
<p><strong>13:05</strong> Still no goals in the men&#039;s seconds football but James Tompkinson reports that Hull are getting back into the game and there have been chances on both sides.</p>
<p><strong>13:01</strong> In the badminton, Dainty and Metcalfe win their second set, and the game, 21-7, There is also victory for Somerside and Hirst, as they triumph 21-3, 21-6. That puts York 6-1 up in the tie overall.</p>
<p><strong>12:57</strong> The tennis is quite equally balanced at the moment - York are up 5-2 in one doubles game but down 5-4 in another. Tension down at the courts.</p>
<p><strong>12:55</strong> York&#039;s badminton players look like they increase that lead too - they doubles seconds, Somerside and Hirst, take their first set 21-3 and the doubles firsts, Dainty and Metcalfe, take their first set 21-14.</p>
<p><strong>12:53</strong> The second lot of matches start in the seconds badminton, seeing Hull forfeit another point and York are 4-1 ahead. Cruising.</p>
<p><strong>12:52</strong> The tennis is beginning to swing York&#039;s way. They take the first set in the doubles against the Superheroes 6-3 to give themselves the advantage. Still a long way to go through.</p>
<p><strong>12:51</strong> In the men&#039;s seconds football game, James Tompkinson reports that with 10 minutes gone, it&#039;s still 0-0 but York are on top. Sounds good to me.</p>
<p><strong>12:50</strong> Hull get a game back in the badminton as their singles player defeats Talfyn Provis-Evans 21-13 in the third set. That&#039;s 3-1 overall now.</p>
<p><strong>12:45</strong> Apparently all the Hull tennis team went out to Revs last night dressed as Superheroes. Ironman and Superman haven&#039;t changed.</p>
<p><strong>12:40</strong> Matt Cooke reports that the Superheroes are currently at 2-2 against York. I&#039;m impressed they are managing so well with the costumes on!</p>
<p><strong>12:39</strong> York have taken the second set in the badminton to level at 1-1 and take it to a decider. They are already 3-0 up overall though, so surely the points are in the bag.</p>
<p><strong>12:38</strong> Here are the scores from the badminton: the doubles seconds first seeds, Oliver Metcalfe and Tom Dainty, win 21-10, 21-4 and the second seeds, James Somerside and Adam Hirst, win 21-12, 21-11. Convincing victories for York. The first seed singles match is still being played, with the Hull player one set up, and the second seed was the forfeited game.</p>
<p><strong>12:31</strong> In the men&#039;s seconds badminton, Hull forfeit a game for not having enough players and York have won the first two games, giving themselves a 3-0 advantage. A good start for York.</p>
<p><strong>12:29</strong> James Tompkinson is heading down to 22 acres for the mens seconds football, which promises to be a great match. York impressed in the football yesterday, taking five out of seven points.</p>
<p><strong>12:21</strong> The superheros, Superman and Ironman, are warming up on the tennis courts. Matt Cooke adds that Hull needs a &#039;super&#039; performance today!</p>
<p><strong>12:13</strong> All the teams are still warming up so no action just yet.</p>
<p><strong>12:04</strong> Men&#039;s firsts and seconds tennis and men&#039;s seconds badminton will be starting soon so let&#039;s hope the boys can get some points for York.</p>
<p><strong>11:57</strong> Nick Hall reports that the Hull tennis team has drafted in Superman and Iron Man for their doubles. Rumour has it they will try to play at least one game dressed in their costumes!</p>
<p><strong>11:47</strong> That victory gives Hull four points and so overall it&#039;s now York 39-13 Hull. There&#039;s more ultimate frisbee this afternoon - outside this time - but let&#039;s hope Hull don&#039;t take all the points there too.</p>
<p><strong>11:44</strong> And the ultimate frisbee finishes 8-3 to Hull. A fantastic display from them and they take the first points of the day.</p>
<p><strong>11:43</strong> Starting at 12pm we have badminton and tennis, so don&#039;t go anywhere else you&#039;ll miss all the action!</p>
<p><strong>11:35</strong> I spoke too soon. James tells me it&#039;s now 8-3 to Hull as they build on their lead all the time.</p>
<p><strong>11:34</strong> It&#039;s gone quiet for now - hopefully that&#039;s a good sign for York.</p>
<p><strong>11:27</strong> York start a bit of a comeback in the ultimate frisbee, reducing the deficit by two, but Hull score again and lead 6-2.</p>
<p><strong>11:19</strong> Hull are really dominating in the ultimate frisbee and go 4-0 up. Will this fixture see them take a few more points?</p>
<p><strong>11:13</strong> And it&#039;s not long before Hull doubles their lead. They are 2-0 up and York are really struggling in possession. Let&#039;s hope this changes quickly and they get back into the game.</p>
<p><strong>11:12</strong> A good start for Hull in the ultimate frisbee. They take the lead 1-0.</p>
<p><strong>11:11</strong> Sam Asfahani has confirmed the men&#039;s firsts basketball will take place this afternoon, despite the earlier one being cancelled. Good news there then.</p>
<p><strong>11:05</strong> James Tompkinson updates me that the basketball is cancelled after all due to too many injuries on both sides and depleted sqauds. Hopefully the men&#039;s firsts basketball at 2pm will go ahead though. Will let you know.</p>
<p><strong>10:58</strong> Both ultimate frisbee and basketball should be starting any time soon. Out deputy editor Mylo Scurr is at the tent waiting to cover the ultimate frisbee firsts match.</p>
<p><strong>10:51</strong> James Tompkinson reports that the basketball has been put back to an 11am start, so that should be starting soon.</p>
<p><strong>10:43</strong> So, next up it&#039;s ultimate frisbee at 11am. Hopefully we&#039;ll have more luck getting that one started.</p>
<p><strong>10:42</strong> Confusion as the women&#039;s basketball team hasn&#039;t turned up yet. I guess this means it will be called off but will clarify soon.</p>
<p><strong>10:35</strong> Last year against York St John, York won 91.25 &ndash; 19.25. I wonder if Hull will manage to get more points than that. They are currently on 9.</p>
<p><strong>10:26</strong> Unfortunately, some fixtures today have had to be cancelled. This includes fencing, rugby, YU Snow and volleyball. But there&#039;s still plenty to look forward to.</p>
<p><strong>10:21</strong> Our reporter James Tompkinson is heading now to the Sports Centre to cover the basketball for us this morning. Let&#039;s hope York can get off to a good start.</p>
<p><strong>10:16</strong> Who went to the campus events last night? I must admit, I watched Take Me Out and Match of the Day and then had an early night. But at least I&#039;m fresh for blogging all day today!</p>
<p><strong>10:11</strong> Coming up today we basketball, ultimate frisbee, badminton, tennis and football. And everything will be covered by <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>! So, if you&#039;re not down there cheering on York, keep up-to-date on here!</p>
<p><strong>10:05</strong> So, a quick reminder of the score: York lead Hull by 39-9 after great performances yesterday, particularly in dancing and netball.</p>
<p><strong>09:59</strong> The weather is looking a bit brighter than yesterday. There&#039;s even rays of sun poking through now and then.</p>
<p><strong>09:56</strong> We start at 10.30am with basketball, so quite not quite time to get going yet.</p>
<p><strong>09:54</strong> <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> live blog is here again to bring you all the scores, news and updates from today&#039;s Varsity fixtures!</p>

<p>Surely they could have realised there were too many injured players to play basketball before the match? Is this the least organised tournament ever?</p>

<p>Sorry about that Katherine. There seemed to be loads of confusion on the sports centre desk, so messages have clearly just got muddled.</p>
