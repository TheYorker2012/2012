		<div class="SubText">The failure of England&acirc;&euro;&trade;s football team has been the subject on everyone&acirc;&euro;&trade;s lips since the home defeat to Croatia, with excuses and accusing fingers pointed in all directions.</div>

        <p>If you believe everything you hear, Steve &#039;the wally with the brolly&#039; McClaren, Brian Barwick, the Premiership&rsquo;s foreign players, inflated wages, Scott Carson, lack of passion, youth training, American football and even the weather are at fault for England&rsquo;s capitulation.</p>
<p>Is it McClaren&rsquo;s <em>fault</em> that he wasn&rsquo;t good enough to bring the best out of his players? Was it Barwick&rsquo;s <em>fault</em> that he had faith in his man? Is it the players <em>fault</em> that they weren&rsquo;t good enough?</p>
<p>Get a grip. The rotten core of English football at the moment is the blame culture that infiltrates every level of our domestic game. Season this with the hyper-unrealistic expectations harboured in every fan (myself included) and the result is one vile-tasting dish.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve a domestic competition to be proud of, and we can boast a handful of very good players. But it&rsquo;s plain to see only one can even be considered to be world class. Terry? Ferdinand? Lampard? Rooney? Owen? ..not <em>Neville</em> surely? No, the only English player worth his salt on the international stage isn&rsquo;t in that list. The Liverpool player has won matches for every team he has played for, on every stage he has played. His record is outstanding, and he&rsquo;s the only Englishman that can truly be considered a match winner.</p>
<p>Got it yet?</p>
<p>Steven Gerrard is proclaimed by many to be England&rsquo;s saviour, but in 63 caps how many games has he won for his country? Since opening his account against Germany the teams he has scored against are the mights of; Macedonia, Serbia &amp; Montenegro, Switzerland, Austria, Azerbaijan, Hungary, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Sweden, and three in two games against Andorra.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday he was outplayed by&hellip;what were their names again? Oh, the infamous Modric, Kovac and doesn&#039;t that one play for Portsmouth? Steven Gerrard is the case that shows how difficult it is to convert domestic top-flight brilliance into brilliance on the international stage. Alan Shearer struggled, as did Ian Wright. Matt le Tissier is another classic example.</p>
<p>However, rather than &#039;Stevie G&#039;, it&#039;s Peter Crouch who stands - literally - head and shoulders above any other England player at the moment. Unfortunately McClaren could not pick a starting XI that allowed him to shine. McClaren seems to view him as a one-trick pony, but this simply isn&#039;t the case. We didn&#039;t create one chance from a knock down, instead it was his stunning individual goal that was the only memorable moment of the night. The goal was class, and it would not have looked out of place coming off Ronaldinho&rsquo;s boot.</p>
<p>Yet it isn&rsquo;t Gerrard&rsquo;s <em>fault</em> that he failed to achieve what most hail as his greatest ability, to &lsquo;get a grip of the game&rsquo; and &lsquo;inspire those around him&rsquo;. Gerrard is a very good player, one who can boast pinpoint long passing, strong in the tackle, a belting shot, combined with tireless passion and desire. His talent does inspire those around him, but he has to improve before he can be labelled as &lsquo;world class&rsquo;, or as the dreaded &lsquo;match winner&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The latter has become the commentator&rsquo;s most recent clich&eacute;. Fortunately it does retain a germ of truth, but has become hopelessly over-extended. For me the premiership can boast only three &#039;match winners&#039;, players that not only can turn a game on its head with a piece of individual brilliance (there must be 10-20 premiership players who can lay claim to this) but do so on a regular basis, and have enough class to inspire match winning performances from those around them. For the sake of interest (and accountability) my three are Ronaldo, Fabregas, and Drogba. These are the three premiership players that meet all three criteria beyond doubt. There may well be others, but for me these are the only &lsquo;match winners&rsquo; in England.</p>
<p>Is it a coincidence that they are all foreign?</p>
<p>Three is obviously not enough to prove a point, but I think it hints at one problem with the English system. Rooney burst onto the scene as a promising youngster, as did Robinson, as has Carson. Ronaldo too came to the Premiership as a very promising player, and he has managed to progress into a world-class player. Robinson burst onto the scene in Leeds&rsquo; 1-0 away win in Lazio, who were managed by a certain Swede at the time. In his time at Leeds and early on at Spurs he continued to show promise, but has failed to develop into the &lsquo;keeper many thought he would be.</p>
<p>Carson, another product of Leeds&rsquo; youth academy, is in the same situation. As a &lsquo;keeper myself I hope one mistake doesn&rsquo;t ruin his future performances or reputation, as he clearly has promise. But the same mistake cannot be made with Carson, Green or Foster that was made with Robinson. Potential is not to be confused with ability. Fabregas and Ronaldo are now world-class because they managed to turn their potential into real output, something that seems to be troubling our English stars.</p>
<p>Our big names are letting the hype go to their heads. Robinson, Carson, Foster, Richards, Rooney, Bridge, A and J Cole, Ferdinand, Gerrard, Lampard, Lennon, Wright-Phillips et al need to learn from the Premiership&rsquo;s greatest stars. Being a promising youngster means nothing if all you are left with are empty promises. The Premiership&rsquo;s best players have achieved the task of turning potential into success: something our English boys need to learn.</p>
<p>For me the solution is a simple one: we need a manager who is bigger than the players. McClaren tried his best when throwing Beckham out of the team, but he ultimately failed when falling back onto his &lsquo;go to&rsquo; guys Gerrard and Lampard this week. Many critics say our players need taking out of their comfort zone, but if we succeed in appointing a manager who is bigger than any one player, and a manager who can truly spot the players who will form the best team, then we can look forward to better fortunes.</p>
<p>Croatia&#039;s captain Niko Kovac made some interesting points after the game.</p>
<p>&quot;Croatia are a team while England are not...sometimes it is good to fall down though.&quot;</p>
<p>He added: &quot;I also believe the expectation is too high here. I think when the England fans looked at the group they were sure their team would qualify.</p>
<p>&quot;You should hope but not expect.&quot;</p>

</div></blockquote><p>It is worth noticing that as we&rsquo;ve slipped to 12th in the world rankings, Scotland have risen to 14th. Only one team separates the sides on official rankings, but in the mindsets of the respective fans there is a gulf the size of the Grand Canyon. England will never create the atmosphere that was created in Hampden Park last weekend because our expectations are unrealistic. Winning is more fun when it&rsquo;s unexpected, so let&rsquo;s admit we&rsquo;re actually pretty rubbish on the international stage, and start celebrating any victories that come our way.</p>
<p>The only reason that we&rsquo;re all looking for someone to blame for our disappointment is because we ourselves were expecting too much. The blame? It&rsquo;s not Steve&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not Stevie G&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not Scott&rsquo;s or Robbo&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s <em>ours</em>.</p>

<p>george, cant believe you are claiming that Gerrard hasnt turned potential into sucess and isnt a true match winner, Champions League? FA cup finals? countless games in the premiership (goal against newcastle last week?). If that man cannot be described as a true match winner then nobody can. Even your &#039;foreign match winners&#039; have poor games, Gerrard had one for England, this does not mean he hasnt turned sucess into potential or isnt a &#039;match winner&#039;.<br />
The fact that all but one player (Crouch) performed badly against Croatia does not suggest a problem with individual players but instead the man-management and tactics from the management team. They can be blamed for poor choices and decisions, and the existence of a poor management team lies squarely with those who appointed it, the FA. After fucking up the appointment of Scolari and decideding not to take O&#039;Neil, the FA took the easy decision of appointing an English manager who was already involved in the england set up, nevermind that he is wholely inexperienced in truly world class football (ex-Mboro manager and england no.2)and is quite obviously laking in motivation and man management skills.<br />
We do have truly world class players in the england set up, they prove this week in week out for their clubs, both in the premier league and European competition.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it McClaren&rsquo;s fault that he wasn&rsquo;t good enough to bring the best out of his players? Was it Barwick&rsquo;s fault that he had faith in his man? Is it the players fault that they weren&rsquo;t good enough?&quot;</p>
<p>Yes on all counts?</p>
<p>McLaren was wretched. He deviated from 4-4-2 twice, and both times it saw us lose. How could any players respect the charmless assistant manager who&#039;d somehow been plucked from mighty Middlesbrough to become head coach?</p>
<p>Barwick et al knew McLaren wasn&#039;t good enough when they appointed him, and just crossed their fingers and hoped he wouldn&#039;t fail to qualify in one of the easiest groups.</p>
<p>And the players themselves? Against Croatia, our midfield should have been bombing forward to snaffle up anything that bounced off Crouch&#039;s head, but instead Gerrard and company tried to hit speculative ninety yard cross-field passes to Shaun Wright-Phillips or Joe Cole.</p>
<p>They&#039;re all useless and I hope they spend next summer reflecting on how poorly they&#039;ve all let the country down. And I hope they do it in the dark, so the FA can use the money it saves on electricity to fund Mourinho&#039;s contract.</p>

<p>&#039;Winning is more fun when it&rsquo;s unexpected, so let&rsquo;s admit we&rsquo;re actually pretty rubbish on the international stage, and start celebrating any victories that come our way&#039; - you don&#039;t live in the real world. The money that English professionals are paid suggests that they bloody well should perform on the internstional stage (not that I could care less about the English national side).</p>

<p>&quot;Even your &#039;foreign match winners&#039; have poor games, Gerrard had one for England&quot; - my point is not that Gerrard had a bad game. I&#039;m not saying that he is not a very good player, and that he has won matches, just that he is clearly failing to perform on the international stage. This is where I mean he is failing to fulfill his potential.</p>

<p>Very good post, definitely agree our talent isn&#039;t being nurtured well enough, but I think it&#039;s happening at an earlier stage. Ronaldo and Fabregas were far better than any English players at 16 or 17, and that must have something to do with how we coach teenagers and even younger. From a very early age Italian kids are exposed to tactics and a lot of technical training. That&#039;s not the case here. It&#039;s probably down to the &quot;grit and passion&quot; mentality a lot of this country unfortunately have. It&#039;s why for example people seem to think Terry is better than Ferdinand. (on the subject of Ferdinand, I&#039;d say he&#039;s our only world class player, not Gerrard. Comfortably the best centre back in the Premiership, and only Puyol and Nesta come close internationally).</p>
