		<div class="SubText">York 1sts 3 - 1 Teesside 1sts</div>

        <p><strong>Football is often referred to by the classic clich&eacute;; a game of two halves. In the case of the University of York&rsquo;s football first team, it seems to be more a case of a <em>season</em> of two halves.</strong></p>
<p>Whilst Mat Witherwick&rsquo;s men started the season with encouraging performances that earned them a respectable position in the Northern Universities League and a decent run in the BUCS cup, getting a win in their BUCS 2B league still eluded them. That was until February 21st when they edged out Durham 1sts 3 &ndash; 2, but last Saturday York showed this long overdue win was not a fluke with a comprehensive 3 &ndash; 1 victory over Teesside 1sts.</p>
<p>Some would have paid more than a penny for the thoughts of Captain Witherwick when he decided to play Murphy ahead of the usually prolific Gouland, but Murphy repaid this trust in him by opening the scoring for the second week in a row. A York counter-attack from a corner left Murphy hassling a dazed last defender, who must have been wondering why did he drink as the York striker out-muscled him, gave a little shake of the hips and slotted low past the Teesside goalkeeper.</p>
<p>York&rsquo;s bright start continued throughout a first half that they dominated. Their 3-5-2 formation meant McLeod had lots of time on the ball sitting in front of the back three, a role in which he revelled as he stroked 70 yard passes to the left and right. The energetic wing-backs, Barnett and Brennan, were more than willing chasers of the ambitious through balls. The athleticism of Barnett combined with the gleeful, gay fashion that Brennan plays his football seemed to be infectious as York kept Teesside pinned back and created more opportunities.</p>
<p>The second goal came through a partnership that has been honed over the past three years and is perhaps still York&rsquo;s biggest attacking threat; the Wilson/O&#039;Shea link up. Wilson&rsquo;s through balls have earned him many an assist in his time playing for UYAFC but this time it was his other weapon, his exceptional delivery of set-pieces, that allowed O&rsquo;Shea score. The former captain&#039;s movement meant he got ahead of his defender and glanced a header into the far corner.</p>
<p>Considering Teesside were on a 5 game winning streak that included demolitions of the league&rsquo;s leaders and second placed team York could have been forgiven for thinking this was as good as it gets, but with 40 minutes on the clock they went 3 &ndash; 0 ahead. A series of passes across the midfield opened up space for Barnett. The winger fed O&rsquo;Shea who in turn drilled the ball across goal for the miniature Michelin-man Brennan to bundle into the net. A Michelin starred goal maybe not, the finish was somewhat scrambled, but the build-up had the home support salivating.</p>
<p>A sloppy start to the second half gave Teesside hope when York really should have demoralised them to such an extent they actually wanted to get on their coach back to the delights of Middlesbrough and Stockton. Their mini-revival led to them getting a goal back from a corner. A strong header was heading in, metres above Brennan leaping on the line, but after hitting the underside of the bar it seemed to rebound of the flailing goalkeeper, Emmerson, and into the net. Another own goal to add to an impressive tally.</p>
<p>With 15 minutes to play Teesside&#039;s hopes were raised further when York went down to 10 men. A questionable bounce on what looked an albeit bird droppings covered, carpet like surface, wrong-footed York&rsquo;s sweeper, Gardner, and left a Teesside winger through on goal. Swan just about caught up with the player, but he more than caught him when his lunge left the Teessider a sorry heap in York&rsquo;s penalty box. The referee had little choice but to point to the spot and show Swan a red card.</p>
<p>York&rsquo;s &lsquo;keeper resembled an Alaskan grizzly as he tried to intimidate the penalty-taker, equally his scruffy beard resembling a lonely wanderer who had gone into the wild months on end. Personal hygiene aside, Emmerson&rsquo;s goalkeeping standards were unquestionable as he got down low to his left and maintained York&rsquo;s two goal advantage. Although Teesside continued pushing, York&rsquo;s defence held strong and deserved the three points.</p>
<p>Next up is Sheffield Hallam 1sts away tomorrow, one of the toughest fixtures in the BUCS Northern Division, but with this new found form York will provide a tough test for the South Yorkshire outfit. York are off the bottom of the table and what seemed a nightmare BUCS league season is fast becoming the stuff Dreamz are made of.</p>
