				Can Alcuin now win the treble?			</div>
				<div class="Date">Tuesday, 10th June 2008</div>

		</div>
		<div class="SubText">The first semi final to be played was won by Alcuin this afternoon, in a style that sent out a clear message to whoever they may meet in the final. </div>

        
<ul><li><strong>Alcuin 1sts 3</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><em>McKay 22</em></p>
<p><em>Smith 27 &amp; 44</em></p>

<ul><li><strong>Halifax 1sts 0</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>Much like France&#039;s game yesterday, this event was completely devoid of goalmouth action in the opening exchanges. But unlike that fixture this game was absorbing with a variety of personal battles all over the park.</p>
<p>McKellow - who was in such imperious form this week - had to replicate his form against University first teamer Smith, while Brennan faced up against third year Webb. The first third of the game ebbed and flowed as each side tried to impose themselves until McKay made the crucial breakthrough from a long range free kick.</p>
<p>Whipping the ball into the area &#039;Pivot&#039; McKay aimed at the back post, it missed everyone and to Halifax&#039;s dismay sailed into the goal.</p>
<p>After the breakthrough it was Alcuin who began to exert their authority on the game and Smith doubled the advantage with a clinical finish from the edge of the box.</p>
<p>In the 29th minute perhaps the most bizarre moment of this year&#039;s tournament occurred, when Wakeford was booked for jumping while a Halifax player was attempting to take a throw in. Towards the end of the second half the ref became a constant focus of attention as Brennan and Smith both fought to earn decisions from him, and ultimately half time probably came at a good time to prevent the tension from boiling over.</p>
<p>Halifax came out for the second half full of intent, but Alcuin&#039;s central trio of Smith, Murrills and Webb were beginning to dominate. The &#039;Fax&#039; were limited to long straight balls which DeLaney mopped up with admirable ability.</p>
<p>Halifax had chances in the second half though as they did manage to play some football in Alcuin&#039;s half, but ultimately they couldn&#039;t fashion a breakthrough, and playing so high up the pitch cost them their third goal. Murrills played a one-two into Cox, then spread it wide for Smith who was clear one-on-one with Halifax &#039;keeper Young. Smith wasn&#039;t in the mood to miss a golden opportunity like this one, 3 - 0.</p>
<p>Both teams had chances as Halifax gambled in the later stages, but Alcuin were well worth the 3 - 0 scoreline this time. They have set a high bar for Vanbrugh and Goodricke to aim at on Thursday. Their midfield trio looked a real powerhouse, DeLaney was dominant at the back, and with Cox, McKay and Williams up front they have plenty of quality in the right positions.</p>
<p>After the game, Halifax captain Fahey said &quot;We didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t play to the best of our ability, we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve got the strength in depth to play better but we haven&acirc;&euro;&trade;t performed in this college cup at all.</p>
<p>&quot;If Alcuin don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t win I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d be surprised, Goodricke are a good team but I think Alcuin have got the best team, they just play well together and know what they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re doing.&quot;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>

<br /><span class="author">Oli Fahey</span>
</div></blockquote><p>Victorious skipper Preston, whose attempts to cast off the tag of being tournament favourites now look the farce that they always were - Alcuin are a very good side. Now they are on form whoever progresses from the second semi-final will know that they&#039;ll have to be at their very best if they&#039;re to get their hands on the cup.</p>
<p>Speaking about todays game Preston said &quot;In the group stages the [3 -0] score wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t a fair reflection, but this time I think it was. In this game I think we outplayed them, I think we were the better team, and I think this is the best we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve played since first term.</p>
<p>&quot;Today Henry Smith was definitely the man, no doubt about that.&quot;</p>
<p>Some gossip mongers had been anticipating Preston&#039;s decision of whether to pick himself, but the situation tailed off meekly when Preston explained, &quot;I unfortunately had a trip to the doctors yesterday with a suspected stomach virus, so that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s why I ruled myself  out. They didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t need me today anyway!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Teams</strong>
<strong>Alcuin&#039; 3-5-2</strong>:<em>Wynd, Swan, Crane, Delaney, Wakeford, Smith, Webb, Murrills, Hyde, McKay, Cox. Bench - Stratton, McDermott, Williams.</em></p>
<p><strong>Halifax 3-5-2</strong>: <em>Young, Evans, Rixon, Broadhurst, Harrison, McKellow, Nightingale, Fahey, Green, Fortnam. Bench - Joseph, Omarov.</em></p>
<p><strong><span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>&#039;s Man of the Match award: Jake Delaney</strong> <em>Henry Smith had a cracker today, but I have chosen to give the award to Delaney for this contribution in the air. Delaney won header after header, utterly dominating his half of the pitch. He stood tall when Alcuin needed him the most, and his calm expertise meant Alcuin never looked troubled at the back.</em></p>

<p>Believe it or not, he is actually ill. His girlfriend has had enough of him whinging about his stomach already!</p>

<p>Dominating performance from Alcuin today. Let&#039;s hope that Goodricke don&#039;t bottle it (like theyre so good at doing) and give the people the final that they want.</p>
<p>On paper, Vanbrugh have got no chance in this semi.</p>

<p>Vanbrugh have no chance!? Lets not forget that we have already played Goodricke in the group stages and they hardly wiped the floor with us did they? Yes, Goodricke do have some exceptional players in their line up but we have a strong team and it will be a great final whoever goes through to face Alcuin.</p>

<p>I will leave the Alcuin 2nds selections up to Matt Bowyer. As for not being good enough for the firsts, well I&#039;ve played 90% of the games this season, and have only been on the losing team once so I can&#039;t be that much out of my depth really! We have won both league titles and are in the final of the college cup, so I&#039;m not going to complain too much about how inept I may or may not be on the football pitch!</p>
<p>Samuel &#039;DNVP&#039; Whittaker, which anonymous comments do you believe are mine?!!!</p>
<p>I will be down on Thursday with eagle eyes...</p>

<p>Myles&#039; record speaks for itself. Lost one game all season as captain - can anyone tell me which college football captain would not have taken that in October? I had the pleasure of being Alcuin captain last year and could not even lace Myles&#039; boots after the work he has done this year.</p>
<p>If you want to have a pop, please put your name on the comment.</p>

<p>I think not only is Myles a good captain as shown by his record (the embarassment of riches that Alcuin football has definitely helps) but he&#039;s also a nice guy. If you&#039;re going to have a pop at him, at least leave your name.</p>
