        <p><strong>21:49</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Cricket Mens 1sts</p>
<p><strong>17:47</strong> Okay that&#039;s it from your Yorker crew, hope you all had a great weekend and congratulations to all sportsmen and women from York and Lancaster (but especially from York) and to Alex Lacy and the York Sport committee! See you in Roses 2010!</p>
<p><strong>17:46</strong> Lacy lifts up the trophy and drinks from it as ribbons shoot out of the sides of central hall
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/3394.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3394.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a><br /></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>17:45</strong> Alex Lacy and the York Sport committee come onto stage now at the sound of music and aplause</p>
<p><strong>17:43</strong> Greg Dyke comes on stage and gives the rugby crowd a nice gesture in reply to their taunting... he is now mocking them mercilessly to a megaphone reply of &#039;Greg Dyke thank you very much&#039; from the rugby crowd. He is undoubtedly a good sport! &quot;You must remember not to gloat - but we did win!&quot;
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/3393.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3393.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Roses Closing Ceremony Greg Dyke" alt="Roses Closing Ceremony Greg Dyke"  /></a><br /></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>17:42</strong> Phillip Hilling, from Roses&#039; major sponsor Ernst &amp; Young compares Roses to the Olympics and explains that sports can teach us a thing or two about real life and leadership, giving the regular corporate spiel. He adds that playing sports that teach individuals how to win. Someone from the audience yells &quot;Lucky Lancaster.&quot; There&#039;s some enjoyable crowd banter going on.</p>
<p><strong>17:39</strong> In quite an exuberant display of smoke and strobe lighting, the Roses Carter James trophy descends from the ceiling onto the stage. Fancy, but a bit much, Antonia personally thought...
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/3392.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3392.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="Roses Trophy" alt="Roses Trophy"  /></a><br /></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>17:37</strong> Jane Grenville comes onstage to a raucous applause from the crowd to recieve the trophy for clay-pigeon shooting, played every year between the chancellors of York and Lancaster</p>
<p><strong>17:35</strong> The Lancaster people seem particularly excited about their trampolining win</p>
<p><strong>17:33</strong> &#039;YEAH!&#039; suddenly screams someone from the audience. &#039;Yeah&#039; indeed!</p>
<p><strong>17:32</strong> the rugby boys as usual providing us with plenty of entertainment, as a clown, an indian and a semi-naked man go up onstage to receive a trophy from a serious-looking Brian Cantor</p>
<p><strong>17:29</strong> Okay, Tom Scott must be getting really tired of saying &#039;York&#039; right about now!</p>
<p><strong>17:29</strong> With banners on either sides of the stage looking Hogwarts-worthy (with colours reminiscent of Gryffondor, might we add), and Tom Scott as a long-haired, benevolent and witty Dumbledore figure, the Roses 2009 closing ceremony certainly feels like JK Rowling&#039;s end-of-year House Cup!</p>
<p><strong>17:25</strong> </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/3387.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3387.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a><br /></div>

<p></p>
<p><strong>17:19</strong> The first trophees for Lancaster are greeted by loud &quot;Boos&quot; from the audience.</p>
<p><strong>17:17</strong> Okay, fun is over! Individual trophies are being given out now</p>
<p><strong>17:14</strong> </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/3383.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3383.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a><br />Tom Scott introduces the ceremony.</div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>17:10</strong> Dancescoc&#039;s up now after that impressive Capoeira demonstration. As usual the routines are slick and fast-paced and they&#039;re even being projected on the screen. Nice.
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/3386.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3386.jpg" width="610" height="230" title="ceremony" alt="ceremony"  /></a><br />York Hornets</div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>17:09</strong> Okay, now that was dancesoc. As usual, very good!</p>
<p><strong>17:08</strong> Okay, sorry, these are definitely not dancesoc people. <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> is guessing gymnasts? Very impressive indeed!</p>
<p><strong>17:06</strong> Some impressive ribbon work! Well done!</p>
<p><strong>17:05</strong> Marie, having had to deal with YUSU health and safety requirements in Central Hall is surprised Peter Kidd cleared all the cheerleading. But it looks pretty spectacular despite minor mishaps! Well done girls!</p>
<p><strong>17:05</strong> Dancesoc up next!</p>
<p><strong>17:04</strong> </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/3384.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3384.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a><br />The crowd gathering in Central Hall</div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>17:02</strong> After a really cool intro video, showing highlights from all sports, its the moment we&#039;ve all been waiting for: CHEERLEADING!!</p>
<p><strong>16:58</strong> Tom Scott is trying to create some suspense as to the winner of this year&#039;s Roses tournament, before introducing YSTV&#039;s kick-ass closing trailer.</p>
<p><strong>16:57</strong> Amongst boos from the crowd, Lancaster AU president and vice-chancellor are &#039;welcomed&#039; onstage</p>
<p><strong>16:55</strong> Cheerleaders and Dancesoc are believed to be starting the ceremony. For the time being, the crowd is singing &quot;Happy Birthday.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>16:54</strong> It is also apparently someone&#039;s birthday... happy birthday!</p>
<p><strong>16:54</strong> Angela Pietz, Yorker correspondent remarks, after being told there will be dancing: &quot;Wow, its like a fusion of sports and dancing!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>16:52</strong> After some slight delay, <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> are here at the closing ceremony. We understand there will be cheerleaders and capoeira. How could we miss this?</p>

<p><strong>15:30</strong> Hockey: York score 4-1!</p>

<p><strong>15:20</strong> Recap: what&#039;s going on now is Football mens 1st, Hockey men&#039;s 3rds, Croquet for 0 points. Archery and Table Tennis are finishing up.</p>
<p><strong>15:20</strong> A &quot;larger than we&#039;re used to&quot; crowd has gathered in the Dance Studio to watch Table Tennis. In the 1st game the score is currently 7-4 to York, though the 2nds are behind with 7-5 to the Lancs. Reza Mafi (3rd seed) looks potential man of the match in the 1st team, having secured a 3-1 victory against the Lancs 1st seed. President of the 1st team Jan Natolski is very impressed with some of the team&#039;s performance, but says it&#039;s still &quot;anybody&#039;s game&quot; for both 1st and 2nds (although it&#039;s best of 16 in both cases, so the outcome will be fixed pretty soon).

<p><strong>15:18</strong> In Hockey men&#039;s 3rds, York are losing 3-0.</p>
<p><strong>15:17</strong> In Men&#039;s Football, the referee gives Lancaster&#039;s 10 a stern talking and a yellow card for talking back. Another substitution for York, as 8 comes on for 9.</p>
<p><strong>15:17</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Basketball Men&#039;s <strong>50-38</strong></p>

<p><strong>15:11</strong> Men&#039;s Football update: 3-0 for York with a goal by Anton &quot;Dreamz&quot; Murphy.</p>
<p><strong>15:08</strong> Lancaster  still only playing with 9 players in Hockey mens&#039; 3rds, as 19 got back on the pitch and off again for lunging tackle.</p>
<p><strong>15:03</strong> 43-37 to York and there are five minutes left in Men&#039;s Basketball.</p>
<p><strong>14:58</strong> Hockey men&#039;s 3rds: Another Lancaster player has been yellow carded for elbowing a York player in the face. Lancaster are down to 9 players for the moment.</p>
<p><strong>14:56</strong> Hockey men&#039;s 3rds: Lancaster&#039;s number 9 who had just scored has been yellow carded for elbowing a York player in the face and arguing with the referee. Those of you who were paying attention yesterday remember that hockey has a three-tired card system  (green, yellow and red) with yellow being a temporary suspension.</p>
<p><strong>14:53</strong> Score update at Men&#039;s Basketball 40-32 to York at the end of the third quarter.</p>
<p><strong>14:52</strong> Hockey Men&#039;s thirds: Excellent York save but Lancaster&#039;s number 9 managed to score in the end. York loosing 2-0</p>
<p><strong>14:51</strong> Score update at Men&#039;s Basketball 36-26 to York.</p>
<p><strong>14:43</strong> End of the first half and it&#039;s 2-0 for York in Men&#039;s 1st Football. A load of oddly-dressed spectators with a megaphone and a giant inflatable banana provide some entertainment. We hear they paid &pound;15 for that, worth it?</p>
<p><strong>14:42</strong> Men&#039;s 3rds Hockey 1-0 for Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>14:38</strong> In Hockey team captain Billy Walsh speaks to <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>: &quot;Although the team was still hungover from last night, and despite mixed never being taken seriously, when we were on the pitch we definitely played well - Hockey was the winner.&quot; A good team performance was definitely evident.</p>
<p><strong>14:38</strong> Score update at Men&#039;s Basketball 30-22.
<a href="../../photos/full/3367.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3367.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>14:34</strong> Another goal to York in men&#039;s 1st football puts the score to 2-0.</p>
<p><strong>14:27</strong> Men&#039;s basketball: end of the 2nd quarter 28-22 for York</p>
<p><strong>14:24</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Hockey Mixed 1sts <strong>7-1</strong> The Lancs got in a penalty flick during the last few minutes of the game.</p>
<p><strong>14:18</strong> Basketball is now 21-20 it&#039;s a close game...</p>
<p><strong>14:14</strong> Men&#039;s first football update: A Lancs player is down, the referee yellow cards 2 others for hassling him about the challenge. St John&#039;s ambulance are on the scene.</p>
<p><strong>14:09</strong> In men&#039;s basketball it&#039;s 21-18 and the crowd are going wild!
<a href="../../photos/full/3368.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3368.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>14:07</strong> Penalty to York in men&#039;s 1st football and it&#039;s 1-0.</p>
<p><strong>14:06</strong> Another goal in Hockey takes us to York winning 5-0 - with team captain Billy Walsh setting up shots all over. Charlie Bartlett has scored two of the goals so far.</p>
<p><strong>14:05</strong> In men&#039;s Basketball 17-15 for York, it&#039;s looking like a close game.</p>
<p><strong>14:04</strong> Play at the men&#039;s 1st Football takes a brief pause as a Lancasterian in a dress runs on to urinate in his own goal, the referee doesn&#039;t look happy.</p>
<p><strong>13:56</strong> In mixed 1st Hockey the score stands at 4-0, ten minutes into the second half. And if you&#039;re wondering who&#039;s leading, that&#039;s &quot;York, of course&quot; according to our correspondant Nick Evans.</p>
<p><strong>13:55</strong> Chris Travis, Technical Director and coder-extraordinaire is now coding to change the scale of the graph on the Roses tab: we hadn&#039;t quite expected scores to go above 180 points for either York or Lancaster... but it looks plausible!</p>
<p><strong>13:51</strong> Men&#039;s Basketball has just begun in the main hall, and the score is currently 3-2 to York.</p>

<a href="../../photos/full/3353.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3353.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>13:41</strong> In Basketball, Sarah Gouveia and Claire Diriane gave an outstanding performance, scoring from all angles, and getting most of their free throws. &quot;Lancaster did really well, and put up some good competition&quot;, said Sarah, &quot;We just wanted it more. The pressure of continuing York&#039;s win in roses really helped, and the massive support we got from the fans gave us so much energy.&quot;

<p><strong>13:26</strong> Ten minutes left in men&#039;s 2nds Football and it&#039;s 3-0 to York.</p>
<p><strong>13:21</strong> More on the said referee: &quot;he&#039;s not biased, he&#039;s just blind.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>13:20</strong> On the football pitch for Women&#039;s 1sts, our special correspondant reports  &quot;I&#039;m not sure what is going on with this referee. I think he might be asleep.&quot; But then again, she might still be dizzy from getting hit in the face.</p>
<p><strong>13:14</strong> Antonia Moura, our women&#039;s football correspondant just got hit in the face by a flying football, she comments &quot;the joys of sideline reporting.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>13:12</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Basketball Women&#039;s <strong>43-37</strong></p>
<p><strong>13:11</strong> York are still on track to win in Archery, though now only lead in 6 points out of 10 across all categories. Still anyones game...</p>
<p><strong>13:09</strong> It&#039;s 5-0 in women&#039;s football at the moment, but York are now looking better in the second half.</p>
<p><strong>13:06</strong> 39-33 in Women&#039;s Basketball with three minutes left.</p>
<p><strong>12:58</strong> There&#039;s only about 8 minutes left in Women&#039;s basketball and the score stands at 33-31 to York. Oh the suspense.</p>
<p><strong>12:52</strong> A quick streak from a Lancaster supporter signals half time in men&#039;s 2nds Football reports, Richard Mitchell.</p>
<p><strong>12:51</strong> As for Mountaineering which was due to happen yesterday, it&#039;s just started and will last for another two hours, we&#039;ll keep you posted.</p>
<p><strong>12:50</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Hockey Mixed 2nds <strong>2-1</strong>

<p><strong>12:43</strong> Hockey Mixed 2nds update: 2-0. Lancaster are getting angry and aggressive.</p>
<p><strong>12:42</strong> Another injury this time in men&#039;s 2nd Football: Lancaster player is being taken to the ambulance, he is walking, though, so we&#039;re not sure how serious it is.</p>
<p><strong>12:40</strong> Table tennis update: 1st 2-1 to York, 2nds 2-2.
<a href="../../photos/full/3349.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3349.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>12:40</strong> In women&#039;s 1st Football, York&#039;s top player is down.</p>
<p><strong>12:39</strong> Some lovely banter going back and forth between the York and Lancaster audience members down at the football pitch. We sing &quot;we go somewhere you don&#039;t go: UNI! UNI!&quot;, they sing&quot; we have something you don&#039;t have: A decent night life!&quot; We may be biased, but we think we have the upper hand on that one.</p>
<p><strong>12:32</strong> Men&#039;s 2nds football has started at 12.00, score update coming soon.</p>
<p><strong>12:30</strong> Basketball update: 21-15. Netball continues to wow the crowd with cider-induced cheering.</p>
<p><strong>12:25</strong> The archery is going to be a long one: starting at 10 they expect to go on for another two hours at least. York are winning 7 out of 10 points at the moment: Leading in the female individual experience and experience team, and individual male novice and experience team. It&#039;s really close in each category though: so it&#039;s still anyone game overall.

<p><strong>12:24</strong> Off to a not-so-promising start in Women&#039;s football 1st on 22 acre, with a score of 3-0 to Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>12:23</strong> These Netball girls are enthusiastic to say the least. Besides, they&#039;re wearing jumpsuits over their clothes: &quot;because they&#039;re comfy and versatile and Netball&#039;s got a thing with dressing up&quot; one of them tells <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>. They&#039;re rather intrigued by basketball.</p>
<p><strong>12:19</strong> Basketball update: 15-11 to York. Netball girls continue cheering &quot;Pycroft, Pycroft! Do it for Netball! Do it for York!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>12:18</strong> It seems that our cheerleading squad the York Hornets won&#039;t be making an appearance until the closing ceremony today, come to Central Hall at 4:30 to check them out.</p>
<p><strong>12:15</strong> The Netball team are certainly eager supporters shouting things like &quot;Defence! Defence!&quot; and &quot;Ooooh.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>12:11</strong> The Netball girls have invaded the viewing gallery to support their team mate, with a score of 7-5 to Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>12:05</strong> In the main sports hall, women&#039;s basketball has started.</p>
<p><strong>12:02</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Lacrosse Mixed <strong>22-5</strong>. <a href="../../photos/full/3358.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3358.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a> Wakefield, current president, thought that the York team outclassed the Lancs in &quot;Skill, fitness, and speed&quot;. &quot;They are several leagues below us&quot; said York goal scorer Rob Cosslett. That said the Lancs put up a good fight at the beginning of the match, scoring 3 points before York had a look in. Rich Ramsbottom turned it around in the second quarter, with further brilliant play and goals from the likes of Rob Cosslett and &#039;Fast&#039; Phil Harold. Another good result for York.

<p><strong>12:01</strong> Table Tennis update: York won the second match of 1st team... and there are fourteen yet to go.</p>
<p><strong>12:00</strong> Alright, let&#039;s clear some of the Table Tennis confusion: &quot;it&#039;s some complicate stuff&quot; reports Antonia: &quot;the second match which we won and the fourth match which is tied 2-2 are actually the first and second matches of the Table Tennis 1st team. The first and third and fifth matches are actually matches 1, 2 and 3 of 2nd team.&quot; Phew.</p>
<p><strong>11:54</strong> Table Tennis update: York has won the fourth set of the fourth match, which is tied 2-2.</p>
<p><strong>11:53</strong> In mixed 2nds Hockey, the score is currently 1-0 to York, but the match has been interrupted by a man wearing an orange bra and knickers... on a bicycle. He may be from York, reports correspondant Anna Goodman.</p>
<p><strong>11:52</strong> Table Tennis update: we&#039;ve lost the first set of the fifth match.</p>
<p><strong>11:47</strong> In Table Tennis we&#039;ve lost the third set of the fourth match now. Antonia reports that she is sitting at what she terms the &quot;journalism alley&quot; where all media correspondants appear dazed and confused.</p>
<p><strong>11:46</strong> Lacrosse update: 22-5 for York.
<a href="../../photos/full/3359.jpg"><img src="../../photos/large/3359.jpg" height="230" width="610" title="Large not found" alt="Large not found"  /></a></p>
<p><strong>11:46</strong> Antonia&#039;s knowledge of Table Tennis may need some brushing up, she tentatively reports &quot;I&#039;m pretty sure we&#039;ve won the third match.&quot; Match number five has just begun.</p>
<p><strong>11:42</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Volleyball Mixed <strong>3-0</strong>

<p><strong>11:24</strong> And down at the dance studio, we&#039;ve won the second Table Tennis game, go York!</p>
<p><strong>11:23</strong> From the Lacrosse pitch, our correspondant reports that York goal keeper hasn&#039;t saved a shot so far: it&#039;s a good thing our defenders have tehir act together.</p>
<p><strong>11:22</strong> First table tennis match has finished with a victory from York. It looks like we&#039;re doing well in the second one!</p>
<p><strong>11:17</strong> In the dance studio, Table Tennis has &quot;kicked off.&quot; There are 4 points up for grabs in the Mixed 1sts and 2 in the Mixed 2nds.</p>
