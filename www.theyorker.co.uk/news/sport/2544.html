<p></p>
<p><strong>In the final match of the tri-college tournament, postponed from Autumn term week 9, underdogs James cannily outplayed holders Derwent to win the competition, if only by a single point.</strong></p>
<p>The match began scrappily indeed, with poor scrummaging and rampant disrespect of referee Rob Donell. Derwent were without five regular starters - one apparently injured in the noble pursuit of defending a lady&#039;s honour from chavs! - and it showed in their lack of team cohesion.</p>
<p>But once the game had settled down, James firmly grabbed the initiative, enabling President Alex Muntus at fly-half to kick two penalties with ease from close range, and James capitalised further on their possession and pressure with a try just before half time.</p>
<p>Following a huge kick from their fullback, James received a penalty from where the ball landed, after a late tackle by Derwent centre Dan Taylor on the kicker. James captain Seb Weir raced to the mark and exercised lightning-quick thinking to send his number eight over in the corner.</p>
<p>With Muntus converting and Taylor being sin-binned for reacting to the penalty against him with threatening behaviour towards the referee, Derwent were pressed firmly onto the back foot. Nevertheless, perhaps inspired by the rallying words of captain Joe Rankin, they drove up the park and secured a penalty kick before the break, making the half-time score 13-3 to James.</p>
<p>Derwent successfully carried through their late first half momentum into the second half period. With Chris Barrett&#039;s huge kicks from 10 and hooker Sean Glas finally finding the beating of James vice-captain Bruce Green&#039;s outstanding lineout jumping, Derwent steadily marched up the park into James territory. And soon this pressure up the right flank reached the 5m line, and a right-left spread resulted in a scrappy forwards try by flanker Luke Bailey on the left, duly converted by Barrett.</p>
<p>Though still narrowly in front at 13-10, James clearly knew that points difference was the only thing currently separating the sides, and indeed that Derwent stood to win the competition if the scoreline remained the same. With this in mind, they bombarded the Derwent defences unrelentingly, so very nearly going over the line three times through flanker Will Maxwell.</p>
<p>Eventually though, James&#039; backs mishandled in front of the posts and Derwent received a penalty and the opportunity for some welcome respite, which they promptly spurned by backchatting the referee. James, however, welcomed their chance with open arms, and Muntus eagerly bagged another three points to move the game further out of Derwent&#039;s reach.</p>
<p>Rankin&#039;s troops were not disheartened though, knowing that a converted try would secure both game and tournament. Powering into the James 10m, Derwent were inches from a last-minute shock winner, but it was simply not to be, and ultimately James deservedly won the match 16-10 and, with their marginally superior points difference, the competition.</p>
<p>Commenting on James&#039; overall victory, Rankin said, &quot;I suppose mathematically, it would be James. However, honestly I never really considered it to be a tournament, otherwise I think we risk setting Derwent, James and Alcuin apart as the &#039;better teams&#039;, who Goodricke, Vanbrugh &amp; Halifax may not be able to play.&quot;</p>
<p>Alcuin skipper Giles Raymond concurred, commenting, &quot;We can call it a tournament, but I&#039;m not that interested in that. This year I believe the emphasis is on the playing of more frequent games and trying to spread college rugby.&quot;</p>

<p>How exactly was it calculated that James won the tournament? My thinking was that because James lost to Alcuin and Derwent beat Alcuin, then James had to beat Derwent by more points that Derwent beat Alcuin by, which they didn&#039;t.</p>
<p>Still, it&#039;s good to have College Rugby back. Perhaps now more colleges are involved, players playing for colleges that are not their own (as both James and Alcuin did) will not influence the outcome so considerably...</p>

<p>Aaah, hallo bitter Derwent player. Its a shame your maths is as bad as your rugby. Allow me to walk you through it.<br />
The results were as follows:<br />
J v A: 10 - 13<br />
A v D: 6 - 14<br />
J v D: 16 - 10</p>
<p>Points difference:<br />
Alcuin: -5<br />
Derwent: +2<br />
James +3</p>
<p>Furthur to your other bitter comment, James and Alcuin both believe in college rugby as an opportunity for anyone to participate in a game that they enjoy. The fact that most of the colleges are still to organise a team means that many don&#039;t have that opportunity.<br />
Anyway, James only had 2 non-college players, one of which was a reserve - we&#039;d just as easily beat you without them. Losers.</p>

<p>I&#039;d have loved to have seen your 13 from the Alcuin game run at our midfield three of Barnett, Taylor and Gore. He would have been absolutely munched as your 10 and 12 were throughout the game by Barnett and Taylor.</p>
<p>As it happens, Si is a good player (shame he&#039;s not from your college) and you relied on him for almost all your decent breaks.</p>
<p>How can you say you would have beaten us without playing what boils down to being a Barbarians team? We lost by 6 points and were inches from a last minute try. We get bad press for attitude but in reality, is it any wonder that neither Derwent or Alcuin lads fancied socialising with you after our respective games?</p>

<p>You did cry off last term and last week though, in fariness...</p>

<ul id="CommentItem5396History" class="comment_edit"><li>Sun, 1st Feb 2009 3:54pm - Edited by the author</li></ul><p>In fairness to both teams, I felt that discipline was pretty good considering the high tension and how even the teams were. Just one yellow card for disrespect- I&#039;ve had much worse. And when the number twelve came back on he was absolutely fine. The real problems were the high number of penalties from both teams, but that was just representative of how passionate the game was played with players pushing the limits to try and get an edge over their opposition. Apart from one or two incidents, the game was not dirty, which was a great change from last year.</p>

<p>it was a good game, and im sure we will play again some time with both teams a full strength etc...<br />
But, as a Derwent player i have to hold my hands up to the first half performance of James. it was played at such an intensity!<br />
but we came out in the second half and did the same to them!</p>
<p>cheers to the ref as well, not the most enviable of jobs!</p>

<p>The Point of the Tri-college Tournament was to increase involvement in college rugby, the result was not that important.<br />
The reason ourselves (Alcuin) and James both fielded players from other colleges was because those players wanted to get involved in college rugby, yet their college had yet to start up their 15s training properly.<br />
James won the tournament fairly, but the more important points are that the tournament went through with good spirits, passion and a friendly atmosphere, promoting college rugby in the best manor possible; also with a good standard of play (albeit a little undisciplined).</p>
<p>I hope everyone will keep the ball rolling for college rugby, which includes the second tri-way tournament this saturday between Halifax, Goodricke and Vanbrugh!<br />
Plus the 10s tournament week 9 this term. This being the only official (as yet) tournament, counting towards college points, I&#039;m sure the intensity, passion and banter will be at its best.</p>
<p>Also whoever posted saying that Derwent and Alcuin did not want to drink with the James team after the games obviously has no clue what is going on. We did go for drinks after the James game, there is a very good relationship between all three teams, with quite a few of us playing together for a club side! College rugby is going to be difficult to become established if we have pointless, negative comments from people like yourself. The idea of it is to promote as much grass-roots rugby as possible and increase involvement! It is not to start petty little rows that will only hinder everything a lot of people are working hard for!</p>
