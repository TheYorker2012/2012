				Alex Lacy, York Sport President			</div>

		</div>
		<div class="SubText">An undercurrent of discontent with the current York Sport regime came to a head last night as several of Alex Lacy&#039;s big ideas were shot down by club presidents.</div>

        <p>Tuesday evening saw the first York Sport Forum, the new alias of an AU general meeting. York Sport president Alex Lacy gathered representatives from the University&rsquo;s sports clubs to vote on four motions: a new York Sport logo design, the uniformity of this logo and York Sport&rsquo;s black and gold colours on all clubs&rsquo; kits, universal York Sport sponsorship, and finally a vote on the constitution.</p>
<p>Although the agenda seemed to change haphazardly, the meeting brought up some controversial subjects that Lacy struggled to deal with; often acting very defensively when any opposing opinion was expressed.</p>
<p>The meeting established one clear message for Lacy: clubs do not wish to be a part of a uniform York Sport behemoth that will prove costly in the transient stages.</p>
<p>Lacy put the poor turn-out &ndash; 24 of 57 clubs were present &ndash; down to problems with the YUSU mailing system. Nonetheless, the larger clubs were almost exclusively in attendance; Basketball, Cricket, Football, Hockey, Lacrosse, Netball, Rowing and Rugby were all eager to use their vote.</p>
<p>However, the lack of other clubs meant the vote on the constitution and the universal kits was left for another day. Lacy appeared hesitant to push through the more contentious reforms without the numerical backing of the smaller clubs. Despite these adjustments to the agenda, debate was still rife about the machinations of such proposals.</p>
<p>The unveiling of the new logo was nothing more than a disappointment. It resembles an LAPD badge rather than a university&rsquo;s sport emblem. Nonetheless, changing the old UYAU badge to this was passed through almost unanimously, with only two clubs abstaining.</p>
<p>The next motion, the compulsory donning of this logo on every kit which must be black and gold, ignited animated debate among the clubs and some presidents didn&#039;t need to be asked twice when offered the opportunity to express their concerns.</p>
<p>Lacy&rsquo;s defence &ndash; teams that &ldquo;come out in the same kit look more professional and get better results&rdquo; &ndash; raised more than a few eyebrows as presidents argued that the excessive costs of replacing their kits could be better spent elsewhere.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<img src="../../images/prototype/news/quote_open.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
Teams in the same kit... get better results
<img src="../../images/prototype/news/quote_close.png" alt="Quote" title="Quote" />
<br /><span class="author">Lacy&#039;s theory on how a university wide colour scheme would benefit clubs</span>
</div></blockquote><p>Questions were asked regarding why the new branding would not say University of York anywhere on the kit. The York Sport president defended his brand saying: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the SU that organises university sport. The University does nothing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This caused uproar as the clubs pledged their allegiance to their university rather than an administrative institution. A point summed up by the football club&rsquo;s secretary Tam Sherif: &ldquo;We play football for the University of York, not York Sport&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As with many issues during the evening he eventually gave in to the vocal opposition and conceded that sporting the new logo would not be compulsory.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, after a further 10 minutes debating the pros and cons of universal black and gold colours, Lacy agreed clubs could opt out of this, rendering a vote useless, and proving that in Lacy&rsquo;s case; the gentleman <em>is</em> for turning.</p>
<p>The last motion lay in the Lacy vision of a York Sport sponsor that would be universally applicable to clubs.The sponsorship would fill the void for many smaller clubs which fail to get funding through this means but would also &ldquo;top up&rdquo; existing club deals, as long as their incumbent sponsor did not conflict with York Sport&rsquo;s choice.</p>
<p>Again, this wholesale measure was quickly complemented by a new opt out clause, as concerns over existing rolling sponsorship deals were voiced.</p>
<p>Lacy must realise that whilst this idea has potential, it won&#039;t bare fruit for several years yet as clubs take a while to replace old kits. If he had introduced this sponsorship motion earlier and this had been seen as the prime reason for the whole re-branding, then clubs would likely have been more accepting, rather than seeing these changes as mere authoritarianism from a President keen to exercise his power.</p>
<p>Throughout the meeting Lacy appeared shocked at the amount of fervent opposition among a wide cross section of clubs. He had to make various concessions as motions became more discursive than elective, often being delayed to future meetings where the President hoped &ldquo;we can discuss it like adults&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the long run it may be the case that university teams wearing the same coloured kits, with matching logos, expressing a more cohesive brand of university sport would attract greater sponsorship for York Sport as a whole, particularly benefiting smaller clubs.</p>
<p>However, the transitional process would take years and Lacy&rsquo;s biggest doubters, the larger sports clubs, seem confident in their own enterprise and ability to raise sponsorship.</p>
<p>It appears that there had been little consultation with club presidents about the motions, and it was fortunate that not enough representatives turned out so that a vote can be properly considered and conducted at a later date.</p>
<p>Lacy must understand that clubs essentially have no loyalty to York Sport, it is only an administrative means to coordinate their participation.</p>
<p>Having discussed the matter further with various club presidents after the meeting, <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> understands that their loyalty lies in representing their clubs and their university, and this should be represented in their logo and their kit.</p>
<p>Their disagreement is not based merely on aesthetics, but on their wish to wear with pride the university or club emblem that <em>they</em> identify with, regardless of what another club one mile across campus is wearing.</p>

<p>If these proposals are for the benefit of the smaller clubs, then why were they the ones who didn&#039;t show?</p>
<p>I&#039;m still not 100% sure why he&#039;s bothering with the whole &#039;York Sport&#039; idea anyway ~ there&#039;s only two reasons I care in the slightest about a result outside of my own sport, 1) It&#039;s Roses 2) My mates are playing.</p>
<p>I&#039;d love to see Lacy getting the cricketers play in Black and Yellow..</p>
<p>Give up Alex!</p>

<p>I can see why he is bothering with the idea- it would be good for all teams to show a greater sense of unity, as only at Roses or Varsity do we ever get teams caring about the result of another sport.  It would be nice to think that with a new name, new direction, new kits and new sponsors, teams would give a damn about sport in general at York rather than just their own.</p>
<p>What I can&#039;t get my head around is Alex saying that they are playing for the SU and not the University- that should not be how people taking the field/court for their respective sport should feel at all, they should be playing to represent the uni. Especially true when it comes to Varsity and Roses.</p>

<p>Definitely the kits should be uniform - we all know England are white and red, Brazil are yellow etc. The gold and black kit would be excellent... however it shouldn&#039;t be put through as taking effect until Sept 09 - people who currently have a kit and will play on next year shouldn&#039;t mind forking over a little money for the idea, and maybe they could get it subsidised if they already have one?</p>
<p>It&#039;s a good idea though...</p>
<p>The SU not University thing is silly though. They&#039;re the University of York&#039;s sports team and people know that. As long as people are kept aware that it&#039;s YUSU who organise everything then having University of York on there is not an issue - sometimes YUSU seem to want the support to go one-way, unfortunately.</p>
<p>It would be good to go to Roses and see all of our teams wearing the same stuff though..</p>
<p>Btw, picture of the new logo? <img src="../../images/smileys/smile.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>&#039;Lazy Lacy&#039; is what they call him in the office apparently. Word is he doesn&#039;t put half the time in Jo Carter did and focuses on these massive wholesale changes to ensure his legacy, but does very little for the everyday running of sport at York. Anon.</p>
