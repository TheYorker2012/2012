        <p><strong>With Euro 2008 around the corner <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span> takes a look at what happened in some of the more prominent European domestic leagues. This time it&#039;s Italy and France.</strong></p>


<h3> Italy </h3>

<p><strong>Seria A:</strong> Internazionale appeared to have the title sewn up by New Year. However, a string of poor performances allowed Roma back into contention. The Nerazzuri finally won the title on the last day of the season, Ibrahimovich going someway to silencing his many critics by coming off the bench and bagging a brace.</p>
<p>In keeping with previous seasons in Italian football there were accusations of match fixing and dodgy recorded telephone conservations. Roberto Mancini, along with many Internazionale club officials and players, was recorded talking to the club&rsquo;s tailor, Domenico Brescia. However, the man was far more than a tailor; he was a convicted murderer with close ties to the Crisafulli Mafia network and an alleged cocaine dealer. Why Mancini urgently required two &lsquo;coat hangers&rsquo; is anyone&rsquo;s bet.</p>
<p>Whilst accusations of match fixing are perhaps going too far, there does appear to be a consensus that Internazionale have had referees on their side all season. Perhaps more will come to light in subsequent seasons &ndash; you can never tell with Italian football. Off the field factors have a tended to determine where the title goes (and when) in recent years.</p>
<p><strong>Champions League:</strong> Internazionale, Roma, Juventus (Q) and Fiorentina (Q)</p>
<p><strong>UEFA Cup:</strong> AC Milan, Sampdoria and Udinese</p>
<p><strong>Relegated:</strong> Empoli, Parma and Livorno</p>
<p><strong>Highest Scorer:</strong> Del Piero - 21 (Juventus)</p>
<p><strong>Surprise Package:</strong> AC Milan never really found any consistency this season despite a glittering array of stars on their roster. Their ageing squad pinned a lot of their hopes on 18 year old Brazilian Alexandre Pato, who was only eligible to start playing in January. Whilst he showed glimpses of his class, his season was intermittent due to injuries. Milan&rsquo;s failure to qualify for next season&rsquo;s Champions League and Berlusconi&rsquo;s resignation should promote a rejuvenation of the squad. A few names have already been signed and some big names have been touted as joining the club, although a lack of Champions League football could prove a stumbling block.</p>
<p><strong>Welcome to England:</strong> Andrea Dossena looks likely to join Liverpool from Udinese for around &pound;8m. Although the left-back may rejoin his previous manager from his time at Verona, Cesare Prandelli, who now manages Fiorentina. What does seem apparent is that now Mourinho is now in charge of Internazionale then we could see a steady exodus of Chelsea players keen to rejoin their Messiah &ndash; Drogba and Lampard reportedly top Inter&rsquo;s shortlist.</p>


<h3> France </h3>

<p><strong>Ligue One:</strong> Lyon sealed their seventh consecutive title, although they stumbled over the finishing line. Bordeaux had reduced a nine point margin to two points with as many games left to play. Lyon were by no means at their best and their dominance should be shaken by Marseille and Bordeaux in the coming seasons; managerial changes have greatly improved the style and attitude of the two clubs this season.</p>
<p>That said, Alain Perrin is leaving Lyon and perhaps we could see a big shake up at Lyon over the summer. President Jean-Michel Aulas is keen to maintain the presence and brand of Lyon and thus headlines should be expected as per usual.</p>
<p><strong>Champions League:</strong> Lyon, Bordeaux and Marseille (Q)</p>
<p><strong>UEFA Cup:</strong> Nancy, Paris St-Germain and Saint Etienne</p>
<p><strong>Relegated:</strong> Metz, Strasbourg and Lens</p>
<p><strong>Highest Scorer:</strong> Karim Benzema &ndash; 20 (Lyon)</p>
<p><strong>Surprise Package:</strong> Paris St-Germain appeared set for relegation but ended up getting in the UEFA cup via an extra time loss to Lyon in the final of the cup. A Sidney Govou goal sealed the double for Lyon. PSG hung on in the league to ensure that they were not relegated for the first time in their history.</p>
<p><strong>Welcome to England:</strong> Samir Nasri is likely to join Arsenal for around &pound;12-13 million as a replacement for Alexander Hleb and would provide some much needed cover for the left flank.</p>
<p>A host of middle table clubs, such as Everton, Portsmouth and Newcastle are incessantly linked with a number of players from the French leagues. Batefembi Gomis and Arouna Diane are both powerful centre forwards; however the latter has had an inconsistent season with PSG, whilst the former has just broken into the French squad and is the first player to score a brace on his debut since Zinedine Zidane. This feat earned him a place in France&#039;s Euro 2008 squad at the expense of Trezeguet and Cisse.</p>
<p>Achille Emana, a central midfielder currently at Toulouse has been dubbed as a possible replacement for Joey Barton at Newcastle. Gregory Coupet appears set to leave Lyon, Tottenham appear to see him as a better version of Paul Robinson.</p>
<p>However, the most coveted player in the French league appears set on staying put; Karim Benzema appears very unlikely to be leaving Lyon just yet despite significant interest from Manchester United.</p>
