        <p><strong>22:12</strong> <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> sports team&#039;s successful weekend is turning sour as they drive entirely lost around northern England. Hopes of reaching Gallery are fading.</p>
<p><strong>19:10</strong> The Roses celebrations are in full swing and the expected combination of rugby and nakedness have resulted in Sam Dudley being gaffer taped to a pillar in the middle of the Lancaster campus. Bets are being taken on what time he will get home.</p>
<p><strong>16:59</strong> Greg Dyke is handing out trophies willy nilly here at the awards ceremony! Drunk rugby lads picked up awards like indoor frisbee!</p>
<p><strong>16:30</strong> YORK HAS WON ROSES 2008</p>
<p><strong>16:29</strong> Jo Carter, AU President says: &quot;I&#039;m so emotional we&#039;ve won it as the underdogs and I&#039;m proud of everyone from York. I&#039;m delighted with the entire BUSA season and I&#039;m extremely happy that it was won by the Hockey Club! I&#039;m so so happy!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>16:28</strong> Alex Lacy, AU President Elect says: &quot;All the sports counted and everyone is running on adrenaline.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>16:27</strong> Matt Knight, AU Tournament Secretary, says: &quot;Absolutely insane, that&#039;s the way it should be, that no-one knows until the last half hour who has won.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>16:21</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Football Men&#039;s 1sts <strong>4-1</strong></p>
<p><strong>16:20</strong> 4-1 to Lancaster in football but their goalscorer sent off for removing his shirt.</p>
<p><strong>16:15</strong> The Essex boy Boltz is the hero of the day, I&#039;ve never been so excited about hockey.</p>
<p><strong>16:13</strong> The beer is flowing freely here at the football!</p>
<p><strong>16:11</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Table Tennis Mixed 1sts (Open) <strong>9-7</strong></p>
<p><strong>16:09</strong> Boltz is the hero, unbelievable. He has dedicated the goal to his mum as there&#039;s always plenty of banter about his mum. He also said the goal was the most emotional play of the hockey team&#039;s season. Wonderful stuff, I cannot quite believe it.</p>
<p><strong>16:08</strong> Goal to Lancaster in football. 3-1.</p>
<p><strong>16:04</strong> What drama, you could not have written this script. Still 2 events to play but an away Roses victory has been secured for the first time since 2002. The hairs on my neck are standing up: amazing!</p>
<p><strong>16:02</strong> York have done it, cue scenes of wild celebration. LET&#039;S BE HAVIN&#039; YOU!!!</p>
<p><strong>16:01</strong> YORK WIN ROSES</p>
<p><strong>16:01</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_draw.html" alt="Draw" /> <strong>Draw!</strong> Hockey Men&#039;s 1sts <strong>3-3</strong></p>
<p><strong>16:01</strong> York equalises! The match ends! Draw!</p>
<p><strong>16:00</strong> There is a hero! Hockey have equalised!</p>
<p><strong>16:00</strong> Someone make themselves a hero! It could be the greatest gallery of their life.</p>
<p><strong>16:00</strong> 8-7 now in the 1sts table tennis.</p>
<p><strong>15:56</strong> <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> has sent the message to the football team to attack. Greg is vigourously waving his arms in O&#039;Shea&#039;s direction.</p>
<p><strong>15:54</strong> York&#039;s last sent off player has just been allowed to come back on (that&#039;s hockey for you). Can they snatch a draw to win the tournament?</p>
<p><strong>15:54</strong> Another York player has just been sent off. Things are definitely not looking good at the men&#039;s hockey.</p>
<p><strong>01:33</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_yorkshire.html" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Archery Novice Female</p>
<p><strong>15:52</strong> 8-6 down in the table tennis, it&#039;s doom and gloom all of a sudden.</p>
<p><strong>15:49</strong> Deflected free kick and Lancaster lead in the football. Table tennis, can you save us?</p>
<p><strong>15:48</strong> York do have 122 points ladies and gentleman, a technical issue is just preventing us from showing it.</p>
<p><strong>15:42</strong> With 3 events to go it&#039;s all coming down to the wire. Incredible stuff!</p>
<p><strong>01:33</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Archery Senior Female</p>
<p><strong>15:39</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Archery Senior Male</p>
<p><strong>15:39</strong> Lancaster has just equalised then taken the lead in the men&#039;s hockey after one of York&#039;s players was sent off. 3 - 2</p>
<p><strong>15:39</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Archery Novice Male</p>
<p><strong>15:39</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Archery Novice Team Mixed</p>
<p><strong>15:39</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Archery Senior Team Mixed</p>
<p><strong>15:37</strong> Nope, 9-1 to Lancaster, Roses is well and truly on.</p>
<p><strong>15:35</strong> Ruth says it could also be 7-3 in which case we win Roses, pandemonium.</p>
<p><strong>15:35</strong> 1sts table tennis score is 8-6 with 2 games left to play.</p>
<p><strong>15:33</strong> Unconfirmed results say it&#039;s 9-1 to Lancaster in the archery. Oh dear. Will get them confirmed asap as our woman at the scene, Ruth, gains more information.</p>
<p><strong>15:32</strong> 1-1 at half time in the football, Emmerson sent off amid controversy as he rushes out to tackle the forward, brings him down but has 2 covering players so is not the last man. Murrills comes off for George Taylor leaving the game poised at 1-1 but Lancaster may have the advantage in the later stages when fitness comes into it.</p>
<p><strong>15:32</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_yorkshire.html" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Lacrosse Mixed <strong>6-7</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:30</strong> Still 1 - 2 in the men&#039;s hockey. Can they hold on for the win?</p>
<p><strong>15:29</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Basketball Men&#039;s <strong>61-45</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:28</strong> Defeat for the basketball. &#039;The Colonel&#039; and his special recipe just couldn&#039;t cook up a victory.</p>
<p><strong>15:26</strong> Lancs just scored with 2 mins to go in lacrosse. 6-7 to York.</p>
<p><strong>15:23</strong> 61-42 to Lancaster in the basketball, looks like it&#039;s 4 more points to Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>15:21</strong> I haven&#039;t eaten or gone to the toilet today, adrenaline is carrying me through.</p>
<p><strong>15:18</strong> So much rests on archery, who would have thought it?</p>
<p><strong>15:18</strong> Lancaster are fighting back in the lacrosse but York still leads. 5-7</p>
<p><strong>15:17</strong> Keeper Emmerson is sent off. I&#039;m crying...</p>
<p><strong>15:13</strong> COME ON YORK, 2 more points at the table tennis leaves us needing 6 to retain the trophy and 6.5 to win. We can do it boys.</p>
<p><strong>15:13</strong> York is back in the lead at the hockey. 1-2</p>
<p><strong>15:12</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_yorkshire.html" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Table Tennis Mixed 2nds (Open)</p>
<p><strong>15:07</strong> Things are looking a little more clear at the lacrosse with York now leading 7-4 at the end of third quarter.</p>
<p><strong>15:03</strong> Lancaster get one back in the hockey. Looks like it could be a tight one.</p>
<p><strong>15:03</strong> Good old Gouland, the lad is clinical from the spot.</p>
<p><strong>15:02</strong> Gouland penalty makes is 1-1 in football.</p>
<p><strong>15:01</strong> 47-29 at the end of the 3rd quarter in basketball. With more Lancaster points on the way there, it&#039;s squeeky bum time.</p>
<p><strong>14:59</strong> York is also winning the men&#039;s hockey 1st. 4 points riding one as well. 0-1</p>
<p><strong>14:56</strong> Latest from the table tennis is 6-6 in the 1sts game and 4-8 in the 2nds.</p>
<p><strong>14:54</strong> Tense times as we are awaiting results which will decide the outcome of Roses 2008. Banter will have to be put on hold.</p>
<p><strong>14:54</strong> Now 4 - 6 York in the lacrosse. With 4 points riding on this the result could be very significant.</p>
<p><strong>14:54</strong> 1-0 to Lancaster in men&#039;s football but Gouland hits the bar as Tam Sherif calls referee &quot;fat bastard&quot;!</p>
<p><strong>14:54</strong> York is leading at the end of the second quarter time in the mixed lacrosse. 3 - 5</p>
<p><strong>01:33</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Football Women&#039;s 1sts <strong>3-1</strong></p>
<p><strong>14:44</strong> Lancaster are coming right back at York, leading both table tennis matches. This will go down to the wire.</p>
<p><strong>14:43</strong> Referee forgets linesman flags in men&#039;s football farce. 0-0 so far.</p>
<p><strong>14:41</strong> Table tennis news, the 1sts are losing 6-5 and the 2nds are 7-4 down.</p>
<p><strong>14:38</strong> The lacrosse pitch is like sand so picking up the ball is hard work according to one of the York players.</p>
<p><strong>14:37</strong> 33-17 to Lancaster at half time at the basketball. Can Joyce and &#039;The Colonel&#039; turn it round in the second half?</p>
<p><strong>14:35</strong> It&#039;s the 2nd quarter in the lacrosse, 4-3 to York now, is this where Roses could be won?</p>
<p><strong>14:33</strong> 3-3 in the mixed lacrosse, another massive 4 points up for grabs. This pressure is getting to me.</p>
<p><strong>14:31</strong> Crowd gathering for football 1sts showdown despite the grey skies. Greg is feeling sick with nerves and the fact that he&#039;s injured so doesn&#039;t get to play!</p>
<p><strong>14:30</strong> With Lancaster well-placed in archery, basketball and women&#039;s football, the gap could reduce dramatically. Could this be the greatest comeback since Lazarus?</p>
<p><strong>14:28</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Hockey Women&#039;s 1sts <strong>2-1</strong></p>
<p><strong>14:25</strong> Despite being one player down, Lancaster grab a goal that may well win them the game. 2-1</p>
<p><strong>14:23</strong> York pull one back in women&#039;s football. Too little too late unfortunately, 3-1 in the final stages.</p>
<p><strong>14:19</strong> York grab a well deserved goal in women&#039;s hockey. 1-1</p>
<p><strong>14:18</strong> York are getting thrashed in the basketball. It&#039;s 23-8 and not looking great.</p>
<p><strong>14:12</strong> Archery holds 10 points so could be crucial as to where the Carter-James trophy ends up tonight. Results in soon for all you archery fans.</p>
<p><strong>14:12</strong> 3-0 to Lancaster in women&#039;s football.</p>
<p><strong>14:05</strong> Most of the second half is going York&#039;s way in the women&#039;s hockey but no goals yet.</p>
<p><strong>14:03</strong> 2-0 to Lancaster in the women&#039;s football now, come on girls! We only need 8.5 more points to win.</p>
<p><strong>14:03</strong> The mountaineers are suffering with food poisoning whilst men&#039;s basketball gets underway.</p>
<p><strong>13:57</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Football Men&#039;s 2nds <strong>2-0</strong></p>
<p><strong>13:55</strong> Scandal at the men&#039;s football as a Lancaster player Aaron Sethy played for both 2nds and 3rds.</p>
<p><strong>13:54</strong> Half-time entertainment, the men&#039;s rugby team form a pyramid, which collapses. We have pictures, stay tuned for them later in the day.</p>
<p><strong>13:54</strong> 1-0 to Lancaster in women&#039;s football</p>
<p><strong>13:54</strong> Half time at the women&#039;s hockey and it&#039;s still 1-0 after York narrowly missed.</p>
<p><strong>13:48</strong> The tension is getting to us all here, I&#039;m busy predicting where Roses is going to be won. Can Tom Coleman and his table tennis barmy army win it for us? Will the basketballers &#039;conquer Athens&#039; and give us our victory?</p>
<p><strong>13:35</strong> 2-0 to Lancaster in men&#039;s 2nd football.</p>
<p><strong>13:33</strong> 1-0 to Lancaster in men&#039;s football 2nds.</p>
<p><strong>13:32</strong> Lancaster women take first blood in the hockey after hitting York on the break. 1-0.</p>
<p><strong>13:27</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_yorkshire.html" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Basketball Women&#039;s <strong>32-43</strong></p>
<p><strong>13:27</strong> Women&#039;s Football 0-0, Lancaster edging it at the minute but are ranked leagues ahead of York so good effort 30 minutes in.</p>
<p><strong>13:25</strong> Tears at the basketball as Lancaster miss from down town and the girl turns her ankle. 8 point lead for York now.</p>
<p><strong>13:23</strong> Tight game in the women&#039;s hockey first. Still 0-0 with some good chances at both ends.</p>
<p><strong>13:21</strong> Still 0-0 in women&#039;s football and 1-0 to Lanc in the men&#039;s 2nds. Captain Remington will have to go for it soon.</p>
<p><strong>13:20</strong> Lancaster call a time-out as 4 quick points give York a 6 point advantage. 4.16 left in the match.</p>
<p><strong>13:18</strong> 5 minutes left in the basketball and York lead by 2. This could be a massive 4 points in the bigger picture.</p>
<p><strong>13:12</strong> Just 12.5 more points to go if York are to do it. COME ON YORKIE</p>
<p><strong>13:12</strong> The rugby boys have stripped on the touchline. Pictures are on their way, girls!</p>
<p><strong>13:09</strong> It could not be tighter, 30-30 at the end of the 3rd quarter in this women&#039;s basketball.</p>
<p><strong>13:04</strong> Women&#039;s football has kicked off with 4 points up for grabs.</p>
<p><strong>13:02</strong> I think this basketball could go right down to the final buzzer. It&#039;s now York edging it 28-27.</p>
<p><strong>13:00</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_yorkshire.html" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Hockey Men&#039;s 2nds <strong>4-7</strong></p>
<p><strong>12:57</strong> 6-4 to York. Special mention to York players 33 and 99 although a convincing team performance all round.</p>
<p><strong>12:57</strong> Goal to Lancaster in 2nds football. Volley from a well delivered free kick. Half time now and it&#039;s 1-0.</p>
<p><strong>12:54</strong> Goal for Lancaster makes it 6-3. Continued hard work for York, think it&#039;s fair to say score flatters Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>12:54</strong> York are making it look easy. 6-2 to York. Another penalty to Lancaster - fantastic save keeps the score the same.</p>
<p><strong>12:48</strong> Half time at the basketball and Lancaster are edging it 25-24. York basketball President Ronan Joyce couldn&#039;t believe that the girls were behind, insisting they had &#039;morally won&#039; the half. No points in Roses for moral victories I&#039;m afraid, Mr Joyce.</p>
<p><strong>12:42</strong> Football delayed by rugby fools chucking 100 odd frisbees onto the pitch. Pretty funny, I guess, but football fans are not amused. Still 0-0.</p>
<p><strong>12:40</strong> A close game to 3-2 in the table tennis 2nds puts Lancaster 3-2 in the lead overall.</p>
<p><strong>12:39</strong> The rugby boys tin men stand behind the goal during a free hit and get sent packing by the referee to huge cheers from the York supporters!</p>
<p><strong>12:36</strong> Already one streaker at the football and there&#039;s more rugby lads undressing now!</p>
<p><strong>12:35</strong> It&#039;s tight at the basketball, with York ladies edging it 18-17.</p>
<p><strong>12:34</strong> 5-1 to York. Lancaster have a penalty - who receive a green card as a whole team warning. Lancaster score to make it 5-2.</p>
<p><strong>12:33</strong> After 5 of 16 games in the Table Tennis, Lancaster 1sts are just in the lead 3-2.</p>
<p><strong>12:31</strong> Penalty by Bravo takes York to 4-1. Deserved victory seems to be on the cards for the team.</p>
<p><strong>12:29</strong> The York hockey team are all about the team ethics, there are no individuals. They prefer to just be known by their number.</p>
<p><strong>12:27</strong> Beautiful goal by player 33, chipped over the keeper. 3-1 to York men&#039;s 2nds.</p>
<p><strong>12:26</strong> Still 0-0 in the football, few goalkeeping errors on both sides but no goals. Alex Richards hit the bar with a free kick though.</p>
<p><strong>12:26</strong> The battle of the fancy dress hots up. As more rugger boys arrive head to toe in tin foil, two Lancaster girls arrive with bright red hair.</p>
<p><strong>12:19</strong> Men&#039;s hockey 2nds still 2-1 to York as the second half is underway. York&#039;s rugby boys have donned their fancy dress and are cheering on the team!</p>
<p><strong>12:17</strong> I&#039;m sitting with &#039;The Colonel&#039; as the York women lead early doors.&#039;The Colonel&#039; prefers chicken to sex apparently. Look at him and you might believe it.</p>
<p><strong>12:14</strong> Football 2nds underway. No score but Laurie Swan has passed a late fitness test after waking up with swollen glands rendering him almost blind!</p>
<p><strong>12:10</strong> I&#039;ve taken my place on the bench with the basketball boys and the defences have taken command in the opening exchanges.</p>
<p><strong>12:10</strong> Half time in the men&#039;s hockey. Really tight game, York still in the lead 2-1.</p>
<p><strong>12:02</strong> I&#039;ve just had to go and have a lie down after all that Erika action. I feel rejuvinated and will bring you all the action from the women&#039;s basketball. Could be 4 precious points on their way!</p>
<p><strong>12:00</strong> Greg&#039;s off to the football, here&#039;s Sned!</p>
<p><strong>11:59</strong> No more final scores and I&#039;m getting anxious, just 14.5 points are needed to win it. That could be men&#039;s 2nds hockey, men&#039;s football 2nds, women&#039;s basketball, clean sweep in the table tennis and just a draw in the novice female archery. If that happens you all owe me a pint. Everyone.</p>
<p><strong>11:58</strong> Lancaster score to make it 2-1 to York. They deserved a goal after prolonged pressure.</p>
<p><strong>11:54</strong> Neck and neck in the table tennis but a long way to go. Those 6 points (4 for the 1sts and 2 for the 2nds) could be crucial.</p>
<p><strong>11:54</strong> Breaking news from the Hockey pitch - the sun has made an appearance in Lancashire!</p>
<p><strong>11:46</strong> Chatting to the American Passball team, as they don&#039;t have full pads they&#039;re not allowed to play full contact and the rules have yet to be made up!</p>
<p><strong>11:45</strong> Weather is still drab here in Lancaster. Grey skies and drizzle, which is probably really annoying for all the team who are out watching stuff. I (Greg), on the other hand, am sitting nice and warm next to a radiator! I predict rain all day unfortunately, which coincidently is what BBC Weather think too...</p>
<p><strong>11:42</strong> Men&#039;s hockey 2nds 2-0 to York. Well in lads!</p>
<p><strong>11:41</strong> Men&#039;s hockey 2nds 1-0 to York, good goal and continued pressure.</p>
<p><strong>11:38</strong> Men&#039;s hockey 2nds 0-0, evenly matched at the minute but York applying more pressure.</p>
<p><strong>11:37</strong> Lancaster is likely to win a large majority of the 10 points available for archery, which may well keep them in the running a while longer.</p>
<p><strong>11:34</strong> Correction: The swimming is actually just a Sunday morning family session. I suddenly feel very wrong for watching that.</p>
<p><strong>11:34</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_yorkshire.html" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Volleyball Mixed <strong>0-3</strong></p>
<p><strong>11:33</strong> Latest from the swimming pool: these students must be young geniuses because they can&#039;t be older than 6 or 7. And why they&#039;ve be entered for a swimming competition when they&#039;re all still using armbands is beyond belief. There are a few tears as water gets in their eyes but the floats have just been brought out and it&#039;s smiles all round.</p>
<p><strong>11:22</strong> <img src="../../images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.html" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Hockey Women&#039;s 2nds <strong>4-1</strong></p>
<p><strong>11:22</strong> York have a post point chant for every point they win. Very impressive, great team spirit. &#039;How far out? This far out&#039; with extended arms and legs.</p>
<p><strong>11:17</strong> York have taken the second set in the volleyball but Lancaster are ahead in the third. I forgot I was actually watching for the last half hour, oh Erika...</p>
<p><strong>11:14</strong> York are finally threatening the Lancaster net in the hockey, and it pays off. 4-1 Lancs.</p>
<p><strong>11:09</strong> The table tennis has just started in the South County lecture theatre. Looks like a few people had as much trouble as I did trying to find where it is as some spectators turn up a few points into the first games.</p>
<p><strong>11:09</strong> York women hockey 2nds are defending much better in the second half but can&#039;t get a shot on goal.</p>
<p><strong>11:01</strong> If the points are reached then play continues, all the players here are really fired up and want to win their matches regardless of whether Roses has been won or not. There won&#039;t be any dead rubbers as there is always pride on the line.</p>
<p><strong>11:00</strong> Women&#039;s hockey 2nds - York still battling hard but finding it difficult to string passes together. Credit to them for battling on in wet windy weather.</p>
<p><strong>10:54</strong> Not a good start at the hockey, we&#039;re 4-0 down at half time in the women&#039;s 2nds.</p>
<p><strong>10:51</strong> A bit more about archery for you: each competitor competes individually and the teams are formed at the end based on who did best.</p>
<p><strong>10:48</strong> Not many people watching the archery. Probably to do with the weather. And maybe that it&#039;s tricky to see if anyone is hitting the target.</p>
<p><strong>10:46</strong> In actual volleyball news, &#039;Sweet Erica&#039; has lost the first set as York take the lead. Erica is lovely, I think I want to be her cheerleader.</p>
<p><strong>10:44</strong> &#039;Sweet Erica&#039; seems to be the cult hero of the Lancaster team. She&#039;s got a cheerleader and a poster. To be fair, you can see why.</p>
<p><strong>10:40</strong> 4-0 Lancaster women&#039;s 2nds. Taunts from the Lancaster team are starting to get on our wick.</p>
<p><strong>10:35</strong> 3-0 Lancaster women&#039;s 2nds. Weather conditions are reflecting the mood of the York camp.</p>
<p><strong>10:33</strong> Goal for Lancaster in women&#039;s Hockey seconds, 2-0 Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>10:29</strong> York have bossed it early doors in the volleyball, it&#039;s 8-3 in the first set and remember this is worth 4 points.</p>
<p><strong>10:21</strong> It&#039;s about to start at the volleyball. A bit late; you can&#039;t rush a warm up. Wouldn&#039;t want to strain any muscles leaping for a smash.</p>
<p><strong>10:10</strong> The crowd is building here at the volleyball, most of the banter at yesterday&#039;s volleyball came from the watching basketballers. Will they show up?</p>
<p><strong>10:00</strong> Just about to start is the archery, women&#039;s hockey 2nds and mixed volleyball. Will keep you as up-to-date as humanly possible.</p>
<p><strong>09:57</strong> For those of you wondering, <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> team had fish and chips last night before going to watch the pool. Tom Wilson (from pool not football) has asked for a &#039;shout out&#039;. He won his pool match to give York a 1-0 lead before we lost 6-3. His hair was immaculate as an added bonus.</p>
<p><strong>09:50</strong> It&#039;s just Sned here at the moment, Greg is currently otherwise engaged. Basically, I slept in my car and he had a much more comfy night&#039;s sleep.</p>
<p><strong>09:45</strong> Let&#039;s give you the lowdown on today: there are 31 events left over 7 sports with 54 points on offer. In the main sports centre, volleyball starts at 10am and will be followed by men&#039;s and women&#039;s basketball from 12pm. Outdoors, there is archery at 10am (rugby pitches) and 4 matches of hockey from 10am (astroturf). Table tennis takes place from 11am with 2 matches before venturing outside again where there are 3 football matches from 12pm and a lacrosse match kicking off at 2pm. Let&#039;s play ball.</p>
<p><strong>09:37</strong> 10am starts for archery, volleyball and hockey. I think I might be watching the volleyball, will let my minions (yes <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> team has multiplied over the weekend, it&#039;s now Sned, Greg and associates) get wet I think.</p>
<p><strong>09:34</strong> Here it is, the final day of Roses action with York requiring 18 more points to retain and 18.5 to win Roses. Today has seen the weather take a turn for the worse but I&#039;m sure this rain won&#039;t dampen any spirits.</p>
<p>Welcome to the third and final day of <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>&#039;s LIVE coverage of the main Roses 2008 competition weekend. We will be continuing to keep you up-to-date on the latest Roses news and results throughout today so don&#039;t forget to check back regularly to find out who wins Roses 2008.</p>
