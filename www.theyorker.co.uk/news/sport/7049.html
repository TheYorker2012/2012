<p> Carrying a boat is tiring work...at <strong>Rowing</strong> earlier today.</p>
<p><strong>18:47</strong> Apparently the Lancaster Rugby lads are out in force as Scottish Warriors, kilts and everything. Will look spectacular with their bleached blonde hair!!!</p>

<p> <strong>Badminton Men&#039;s 1sts</strong> about an hour ago</p>
<p><strong>18:26</strong> York take a 2-1 lead in the <strong>Women&#039;s Pool</strong> as the <strong>Men&#039;s Pool</strong> gets under way with England skipper Mike Walsh up first for York</p>
<p><strong>18:25</strong> Lancaster are bossing the <strong>Fencing Men&#039;s 2nds</strong> but it doesn&#039;t gain them any points. Such a shame...</p>
<p><strong>18:24</strong> And it&#039;s Lancaster that take an early lead in the <strong>Women&#039;s Darts</strong>, <strong>2-0</strong> they lead now</p>
<p><strong>18:23</strong> Aimee Howarth tells me that it&#039;s 1-1 in the <strong>Women&#039;s Pool</strong></p>
<p><strong>18:23</strong> Full time in the <strong>Men&#039;s Hockey Firsts</strong> as York win 3-0! Great performance from UYHC as they win four of their five games on Roses Saturday!</p>
<p><strong>18:20</strong> And it&#039;s 2-1 to York in both the <strong>Men&#039;s and Women&#039;s Badminton</strong>. Good work out in the Sports Centre from Team York!</p>
<p><strong>18:18</strong> <strong>York Men&#039;s Hockey Firsts</strong> captain Andy Harris scores a drag flick to make it 3-0 to York. They are absolutely bossing this game, and surely will take four more points now!</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Rowing</strong> at the River Ouse.</p>
<p><strong>18:06</strong> It&#039;s all going a little bit quiet here...</p>
<p><strong>17:58</strong> Lancaster lead the <strong>Men&#039;s 2nds Fencing</strong> <strong>45-43</strong> with just the epee left to fight. Time to wind it up for a big finish now York!</p>
<p><strong>17:52</strong> York&#039;s <strong>Women&#039;s Fencers</strong> win their game on points according to Miranda. That&#039;s better from York!</p>
<p><strong>17:51</strong> Lancaster gain some ground back in the <strong>badminton</strong>. Greene and Davies losing the first set, and Watterson and Hor pegged back to 1-1. Suddaby and Farrington also lost in their match. Bad times!</p>
<p><strong>17:49</strong> Lancaster have caught up in the <strong>Men&#039;s 2nds fencing</strong> and now lead York 31-30 in the sabre</p>
<p><strong>17:47</strong> Lancaster are currently slightly ahead in the <strong>pool</strong>, as <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>&#039;s very own Aimee Howarth is about to play her game. Go on Aimee, show them all why Yorkshire is the better county!</p>

<p><strong>Fencing</strong> highlights of the day!</p>
<p><strong>17:45</strong> Davies and Greene are now behind in their <strong>Men&#039;s Firsts Badminton</strong> game. Not so good, come on lads lets try and turn this one around, yes?</p>
<p><strong>17:42</strong> Baillie and Watterson are level at 1-1 in their doubles <strong>Badminton</strong> match</p>
<p><strong>17:41</strong> York lead in the <strong>Men&#039;s 2nds Sabre Fencing</strong> by 25 points to Lancaster&#039;s 22.</p>
<p><strong>17:40</strong> Oh and it just gets better and better for York in the <strong>Men&#039;s Hockey Firsts</strong>. George Richards makes it <strong>2-0</strong> to York and the Lancaster crowd is silenced! Happy days!</p>
<p><strong>17:38</strong> According to Mylo Scurr there is some serious banter flying around in the <strong>Men&#039;s Hockey Firsts</strong> game! York lead 1-0 thanks to a good finish from Sivagnamam! We like this.</p>
<p><strong>17:36</strong> Women&#039;s doubles also in play in the <strong>badminton</strong>. Lizzy says that they look &quot;out of breath&quot; but are &quot;doing well&quot;!</p>
<p><strong>17:36</strong> York women on top in the <strong>fencing</strong> as they take the foil <strong>45-17</strong>. 26 points needed for an overall win now.</p>
<p><strong>17:34</strong> Watterson and Hor win for York! 21-11 in the <strong>badminton</strong>. They now lead by one set.</p>
<p><strong>17:33</strong> York <strong>Men&#039;s 2nds</strong> are not doing so well in the <strong>fencing</strong>. They trail 12-9.</p>
<p><strong>17:30</strong> Lizzy also tells me that there is strong support for York down at the Sports Centre, with Davies and Green making up the second doubles team for the White Rose.</p>
<p><strong>17:28</strong> And just as I say that things are going quiet, Lizzy informs me that York are on top in the <strong>Men&#039;s Doubles Badminton</strong> with Watterson and Hor leading the charge. Excellent start for the lads there.</p>
<p><strong>17:27</strong> Things are starting to wind down now on what has been a hectic Roses Saturday. However, what we can say is that it has been a wonderful day for York, and hopefully we should be well set going into tomorrow! Still a few things to finish tonight, <strong>pool, badminton, darts and polo</strong>, so hopefully York will triumph there as well to bring an excellent day to an end!</p>
<p><strong>17:22</strong> We&#039;re about to get under way in the <strong>women&#039;s pool</strong>. Hopefully the girls will be able to carry on and add even more success to York&#039;s excellent day today!</p>
<p><strong>17:19</strong> Lancaster take the <strong>Men&#039;s 2nds Fencing Foil</strong> 45-40, but the women are 35-15 up in their match with one weapon left.</p>
<p><strong>17:04</strong> And in a side move away from Roses, Manchester City have won the 2011 FA Cup! United win the league as well today, so you can&#039;t help thinking that Manchester will be the place to be tonight (second to York of course!). See, whoever said we don&#039;t bring you variety?</p>
<p><strong>17:01</strong> York&#039;s girls are also <strong>15-6</strong> up in their foil game in the <strong>Fencing</strong></p>
<p><strong>17:00</strong> York are coming back in the <strong>fencing</strong> and now trail by just three points thanks to excellent foil work from Oli Whear. They now trail 25-22.</p>
<p><strong>16:58</strong> Deputy Editor Lizzy Pennock is on her way to the <strong>Badminton Men&#039;s and Women&#039;s Firsts</strong> game leaving me (James) soley in charge of the liveblog. Could be a dangerous move...</p>
<p><strong>16:56</strong> York win in the <strong>volleyball</strong>. That&#039;s another four points to the White Rose, and a top effort by the lads to hold their nerve and see the game out.</p>
<p><strong>16:53</strong> And it&#039;s all over in the <strong>Men&#039;s Rugby Seconds</strong> as York win 19-11. We are on fire this afternoon!</p>
<p><strong>16:52</strong> York win the <strong>women&#039;s hockey 1sts</strong> game by three goals to one. Great work by the girls there! That&#039;s three out of the four hockey games that have been played today won by York!</p>
<p><strong>16:51</strong> Lancaster coming back in the <strong>volleyball</strong> and it&#039;s now <strong>16-16</strong> in the fourth set.</p>
<p><strong>16:48</strong> Lancaster pushing hard in the <strong>Men&#039;s Rugby 2nds</strong> but the York defence holds firm.</p>
<p><strong>16:45</strong> <strong>15-9</strong> to York in the <strong>volleyball</strong>. Close it out lads! COME ON YORK!!</p>
<p><strong>16:42</strong> Still <strong>19-11</strong> to York in the <strong>Men&#039;s Rugby 2nds</strong></p>
<p><strong>16:41</strong> The <strong>Women&#039;s 2nds fencing team</strong> lose 45-37 in the <strong>fencing</strong> sabre</p>
<p><strong>16:41</strong> </p>

<p><strong>16:41</strong> York lead <strong>12-4</strong> in the fourth set of the <strong>Men&#039;s 1sts Volleyball</strong>. Harriet says that &quot;the Lancaster lads are losing their focus.&quot; Probably because they are on the verge of defeat...</p>
<p><strong>16:38</strong> Update from the <strong>fencing</strong>. Miranda tells me that the <strong>Men&#039;s 2nds</strong> are under way, and the women are 42-34 behind in the sabre.</p>
<p><strong>16:37</strong> News Editor Aimee Howarth tells me that she&#039;s nervous about her pool match tonight. Relax Aimee, <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span> is behind you all the way!!</p>
<p><strong>16:36</strong> York take the third set in the <strong>volleyball</strong>. One more set for victory, see it home now boys!</p>

<p><strong>16:29</strong> Lucie Vincer comments &quot;one of the Lancaster fans is wearing a cape, I wonder if he&#039;s superman?&quot; Wise words indeed...</p>

<p><strong>16:17</strong> York are also dominating in the <strong>volleyball</strong> and lead 6-2.</p>
<p><strong>16:16</strong> York lead the <strong>fencing</strong> by 40 points to 29. They need three points from the last fight for victory. See it home York!</p>

<p><strong>Tennis Men&#039;s 2nds</strong></p>
<p><strong>13:01</strong> Lizzy reports that there&#039;s &quot;an old guy joining in the open dance. He&#039;s got some pretty good moves actually!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>13:00</strong></p>
<p><strong>13:00</strong> Final score in the <strong>Mixed Table Tennis</strong> is <strong>10-7</strong> to the red rose. That was close.</p>
<p><strong>12:58</strong> There&#039;s tries galore for Lancaster in the <strong>Women&#039;s Rugby</strong> and they shoot to a huge <strong>36-0</strong> lead, despite missing multiple conversions.</p>
<p><strong>12:57</strong> While the <strong>Dancing</strong> scores are compiled there&#039;s an open dance. Lizzy says one of the York dancers has a tuxedo saying &quot;pure class&quot; on the pocket - tacky but brilliant!</p>
<p><strong>12:54</strong> Harriet reports that York are dominating in the <strong>Tennis</strong> and the Lancaster player has just thrown his racket to the floor in disgust. York have won three singles and three doubles so far.</p>
<p><strong>12:53</strong> </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/7520.jpg"><img src="../../photos/LiveblogImage/7520.jpg" width="620" height="250" title="badminton" alt="badminton"  /></a><br /></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Badminton Men&#039;s 2nds</strong></p>
<p><strong>12:53</strong> Lancaster pull back two goals in the <strong>Women&#039;s First&#039;s Football</strong>, making it <strong>3-2</strong> to York. The keeper was at fault for the last goal but made several excellent saves earlier.</p>
<p><strong>12:52</strong> Lancaster win the final end in the <strong>Badminton Mixed</strong> with a score of <strong>23-25</strong>, making the final score <strong>4-5</strong> to Lancaster. However, York lead <strong>7-2</strong> in the <strong>Men&#039;s Seconds</strong></p>
<p><strong>12:50</strong> Harriet reports that York are doing well in the <strong>Squash</strong> first round matches. The men won 3,1 and 3,0 and the women both won 3,0!</p>
<p><strong>12:48</strong> The last latin final in under way in the <strong>Dancing</strong>. &quot;There&#039;s feet and sequins flying everywhere&quot; says Lizzy.</p>
<p><strong>12:47</strong> Harriet reports from the <strong>Tennis</strong> that the supporters are mocking the Lancaster players...that&#039;s not very sportsmanlike!</p>
<p><strong>12:46</strong> There&#039;s a goal for York in the <strong>Women&#039;s First&#039;s Football</strong> so that&#039;s <strong>3-0</strong> to York!</p>
<p><strong>12:45</strong> Lizzy reports that York couples 29 and 9 in the <strong>Dancing</strong> &quot;completely owned the advanced latin final - so sexy and sultry!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>12:42</strong> Lancaster score another try in the <strong>Women&#039;s Rugby</strong> but don&#039;t quite make the conversion. The score is <strong>10-0</strong> to Lancaster</p>
<p><strong>12:40</strong> It&#039;s half time in the <strong>Women&#039;s First&#039;s Football</strong> and York lead <strong>2-0</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>12:35</strong> <strong>Badminton Mixed</strong>: Final game <strong>1-1</strong> on both sides.</p>
<p><strong>12:32</strong> The <strong>Men&#039;s Third&#039;s Football Team</strong> have forfieted their points after being unable to field a team. Surely they could have found somebody to play, I could have even played (well...)!!</p>
<p><strong>12:30</strong> Not good news as the paramedics are out at the <strong>Women&#039;s Rugby</strong> to attend to a York girl who appears to have been knocked out.</p>
<p><strong>12:28</strong> VICTORY IN THE ROUNDERS! Oh that&#039;s a huge turnaround from York! <strong>26.5 to 26</strong> wins the game, and Lancaster are not happy!</p>
<p><strong>12:26</strong> Bad news in the <strong>Women&#039;s Rugby</strong> as Lancaster score the opening try against the run of play. Conversion is missed though, so <strong>5-0</strong> to Lancaster is the score</p>
<p><strong>12:25</strong> Lizzy says that York&#039;s first couple are doing well in the Cha-Cha. She&#039;s also commenting on the lad&#039;s hip action. Settle down girl!!</p>
<p><strong>12:24</strong> York coming back strong in the <strong>rounders</strong> with good long hitting. They&#039;re up to 22 now, just 4 behind Lancaster!</p>
<p><strong>12:23</strong> Lizzy is cringing at the <strong>dancing</strong> as the latin gets going to Tom Jones&#039; &quot;Sex Bomb&quot;. Bad times...</p>
<p><strong>12:22</strong> York are winning <strong>1-0</strong> in the <strong>Women&#039;s Indoor Football</strong>. Good start there!</p>
<p><strong>12:20</strong> Aimee tells me that in the <strong>rounders</strong>, York are rallying and are now up to 19 rounders. The Lancaster fans are a little quieter now... good times!</p>
<p><strong>12:19</strong> Official Score Update: <strong>York 21.5 - 23.5 Lancaster</strong> This is better from York!</p>
<p><strong>12:17</strong> Aimee tells me that it&#039;s freezing out on 22 acres. I wouldn&#039;t know, V-Bar is quite warm...</p>
<p><strong>12:17</strong> And it&#039;s all over in the <strong>Men&#039;s Indoor Football</strong> as York win 7-3. Top effort from the lads at the Sports Centre!</p>
<p><strong>12:16</strong> York pressing hard in the <strong>Women&#039;s Rugby 1sts</strong>. They come within inches of a try but are kept out by Lancaster. Still 0-0 there but positive signs for the White Rose!</p>
<p><strong>12:15</strong> Much better from the York lads in the <strong>Men&#039;s Indoor Football</strong>. They lead 6-3.</p>
<p><strong>12:14</strong> According to Lizzy you can see the girl of York&#039;s number 29 pair&#039;s pants. Lizzy reckons she&#039;s going for extra points! Clearly Lizzy is focusing on the sport there...</p>
<p><strong>12:13</strong> York going nicely in the <strong>rounders</strong> now. They are up to 15 thanks to a few dropped catches from Lancaster!</p>
<p><strong>12:12</strong> Tense times in the <strong>Mixed Badminton</strong>. It&#039;s 4-4 as we move into the final game, with James Davies and Laura Suddably playing for York. COME ON YORK!!!</p>
<p><strong>12:09</strong> 2 more points to Lancaster as the <strong>Men&#039;s Second&#039;s Table Tennis</strong> finishes <strong>12-4</strong> to the Red Rose</p>
<p><strong>12:08</strong> York about to start their second innings in the <strong>rounders</strong>. They trail by 16.</p>
<p><strong>12:08</strong> Lizzy tells me that the latin <strong>dancing</strong> is about to start and there are some very questionable outfits including big green dresses and frilly white shirts!</p>
<p><strong>12:07</strong> Disaster in the <strong>Men&#039;s Indoor Football</strong> as Lancaster score two quick goals after half time to make it <strong>3-3</strong></p>
<p><strong>12:06</strong> Lancaster are up to 23 <strong>rounders</strong> now but losing players quickly!</p>
<p><strong>12:06</strong> Bryony Holleran is at the <strong>Women&#039;s Rugby 1sts game</strong> Big chance for York here with 4 points on offer. Bryony tells me that the York girls look really up for this!</p>
<p><strong>12:02</strong> Steve Puddicombe tells me that it&#039;s half time in the <strong>Men&#039;s Indoor Football</strong> and York lead <strong>3-1</strong>. Good work lads!</p>
<p><strong>12:00</strong> COMEDY MOMENT ALERT. The backstop gets hit in the face in the <strong>rounders</strong>. Ok maybe it wasn&#039;t that funny...</p>
<p><strong>12:00</strong> York are rallying in the <strong>rounders</strong> now and have taken three quick wickets (is it wickets, or is that my cricket brain coming into play?) Anyway, three good catches according to Aimee as York desperately try and turn that one around.</p>
<p><strong>11:58</strong> York are all out for 10 in the <strong>rounders</strong> which means that Lancaster hold an 8.5 point advantage moving into the second innings. Great work from news editor Aimee Howarth to keep us all nicely informed about events on Fortress (or less so as the case is proving to be!) 22 acres.</p>
<p><strong>11:56</strong> Lancaster now 7-3 up against York in the <strong>Men&#039;s Firsts Table Tennis</strong>. What&#039;s going on there lads?!</p>
<p><strong>11:55</strong> Lizzy Pennock had &quot;never realised that dancing could be so violent&quot; as someone takes a tumble! I also have it on good authority that &quot;Luke Malkin is compering very nicely&quot;. Shame I know nothing about dancing so can&#039;t tell you all what that means!</p>
<p><strong>11:54</strong> Lancaster are also shelling catches in the <strong>rounders</strong>! But York still trail by over 10 rounders with 4 players left to bat. Big effort needed from York there!</p>
<p><strong>11:53</strong> York Women&#039;s 2nds have taken the lead in the <strong>hockey</strong>, and Mylo Scurr tells me that there is &quot;much less chat coming from the Lancaster side than there was this morning&quot;. We like this.</p>
<p><strong>11:51</strong> <strong>1-1</strong> between York and Lancaster in the <strong>Men&#039;s Indoor Football</strong></p>
<p><strong>11:51</strong> Not looking good for York in the <strong>Rounders</strong>. Aimee Howarth reports that Lancaster are fielding really well after making 18.5 rounders. York have two players out already and only 5.5 rounders.</p>
<p><strong>11:49</strong> And we have our first injury of the day as a York player hobbles off in the <strong>Indoor Football</strong></p>
<p><strong>11:48</strong> Bryony Holleran reports that York are winning in the <strong>Mixed Lacrosse</strong> out on 22 acres!</p>
<p><strong>11:47</strong> She also comments that &quot;there is more fake tan in one room at the <strong>dancing</strong> than in the whole of Newcastle!&quot; Easy now Lizzy!</p>
<p><strong>11:46</strong> York&#039;s couple number 29 looking strong in the <strong>dancing</strong>, and now look set to take on Lancaster&#039;s strongest pairing according to Deputy Editor Lizzy Pennock.</p>
<p><strong>11:45</strong> Wonderful news from the <strong>Badminton Men&#039;s 2nds</strong> as York take <strong>2 points</strong>! We&#039;re still playing in the <strong>Mixed Badminton</strong> so stay tuned for results there!</p>
<p><strong>11:43</strong> We are expecting a start in the <strong>Men&#039;s Indoor Football</strong> very soon! Apparently there was a mix up between the York football and futsol teams with each thinking they were due to play!</p>
<p><strong>11:40</strong> Lancaster win the <strong>Table Tennis Men&#039;s Second&#039;s</strong> 9-3, and Lizzy tells me that the York outfits pale in comparison to Lancaster&#039;s outfits in the dancing. <strong>2 more points to the Red Rose</strong></p>
<p><strong>11:37</strong> Lizzy reports that Lancaster lead 8-3 in the <strong>table tennis</strong>. Bad times for York.</p>
<p><strong>11:36</strong> Aimee Howarth reports that Lancaster are halfway through their first innings in the <strong>rounders</strong> and have had two more run outs. York also finally start to take their catches as one more Lancastrian is out</p>
<p><strong>11:30</strong> Full time in <strong>Indoor Football Women&#039;s 2nds</strong> and York win <strong>7-3</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>11:29</strong> <strong>DanceSport Advanced Waltz</strong> started with a bang, as two York couples collide into each other. Whoops.</p>
<p><strong>11:27</strong> <strong>Rounders</strong>: 3 dropped catches by York but another run out. Lancaster gain 2 more rounders!</p>
<p><strong>11:26</strong> <strong>Rounders</strong>: Good fielding from York. 2 run outs so far. Lancaster have 4 rounders so far. Just heard one of the players say &quot;I haven&#039;t played rounders for ages!&#039;&quot; Inspiring really!</p>
<p><strong>11:22</strong> Full time in <strong>Hockey Men&#039;s 3rds</strong> and York lose <strong>2-0</strong>. Shame!</p>
<p><strong>11:20</strong> <strong>Rounders</strong> is finally kicking off! York to field first, while the Lancaster team drinks beer on the sidelines! Is this kosher?</p>
<p><strong>11:18</strong> <strong>Badminton Mixed</strong>: <strong>2-2</strong> at the moment!</p>
<p><strong>11:17</strong> <strong>Badminton Men&#039;s 2nds</strong>: <strong>3-1</strong> to York</p>
<p><strong>11:16</strong> Lancaster have finally managed to get the 9 players they need for <strong>Rounders</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>11:16</strong> <strong>Dance Sport</strong>: Lancaster have utterly out-performed York on the introduction dance, with mixed vintage and contemporary music, they showed a quirky character.</p>
<p><strong>11:14</strong> <strong>Hockey Men&#039;s 3rds</strong>: Another great save from the Lancaster keeper! And Lancaster score again! With just 8 minutes left in the game things are not looking up for York.</p>
<p><strong>11:13</strong> Lancaster lead <strong>6-3</strong> in <strong>Table Tennis Men&#039;s 2nds</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>11:13</strong> It&#039;s half time in <strong>Indoor Football Women&#039;s 2nds</strong> and York lead <strong>5-1</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>11:11</strong> York have won two doubles matches in <strong>Tennis Men&#039;s 2nds</strong>  <strong>6-3</strong> <strong>6-0</strong> and <strong>7-5 5-3</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>11:10</strong> In <strong>Hockey Men&#039;s 3rds</strong>, Lancaster missed a great chance, but still lead <strong>1-0</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>11:09</strong> There is confusion at 22 Acres as Lancaster struggle to get a <strong>Rounders</strong> team together!</p>
<p><strong>11:08</strong> The Lancastrian team are looking very swich in red but there&#039;re smart suits and sparkly dresses aplenty for York in <strong>Dance Sport</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>11:07</strong> News Editor Aimee Howarth reports that the Lancaster <strong>Rounders</strong> team are running late, delaying the start of play.  York&#039;s Beth Miller tells <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span> that the team is &#039;&quot;nervous as this is the first time the team will be competing in Roses for points.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>11:05</strong> Just to clarify  there are three doubles games and six single games for <strong>Tennis Men&#039;s 2nds</strong>. At the third doubles game York is up by 1 set, leading the second set <strong>5-0</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>11:02</strong> <strong>Hockey Men&#039;s 3rds</strong>: York still losing and Lancaster fans are making sure they know it! Can&#039;t seem to turn pressure into goals  and it looks like it will cost them!</p>
<p><strong>11:01</strong> Doubles games for <strong>Tennis Men&#039;s 2nds</strong> have finished with <strong>6-4</strong> <strong>1-1</strong> and <strong>7-5</strong> <strong>2-2</strong>, both to York! <strong>York Win!</strong></p>
<p><strong>10:59</strong> There are a few drops of rain around as York trails in <strong>Hockey Men&#039;s 3rds</strong> <strong>1-0</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>10:57</strong> For the doubles in <strong>Tennis Men&#039;s 2nds</strong>, York is taking early advantage, leading <strong>4-3</strong> and 5-4<strong> in both games.</strong></p>
<p><strong>10:54</strong> In the <strong>Badminton Mixed</strong> York&#039;s James Hor and Liz Mcfadzean have won their first end <strong>21-19 in a close match against N. Rylandes and S. Hall, coming back from being initially </strong>2-8<strong> down.</strong></p>

<p><strong>10:39</strong> <strong>5-1</strong> to Lancaster in <strong>Table Tennis Mixed 2nds</strong> now. Wake up York!</p>

<p><strong>10:16</strong> <strong>1-0</strong> in <strong>Table Tennis Mixed 2nds and 1sts</strong> at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>10:06</strong> Comment Editor Harriet Evans reports that the <strong>Badminton</strong> teams are now warming up, and that the Lancaster team even booked a court this morning to get in some more court time! Feeling the competition are we Lancaster?</p>
<p><strong>09:57</strong> Lizzy is fraternising with the enemy at the moment, with a Nouse and Lancastrian reporter! Noo stay away from the dark side Lizzy!</p>
<p><strong>09:54</strong> It&#039;s all a little bit quite this morning! Although things will get much busier as the day goes on. I have to agree with Chiifen (who seems to be falling asleep!), we are here a little too early! Shows we&#039;re keen though...</p>
<p><strong>09:44</strong> Lizzy just reported that <strong>Table Tennis Mixed 2nds and 1sts</strong> haven&#039;t actually started yet! What are we doing here so early then?</p>
<p><strong>09:43</strong> </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/7517.jpg"><img src="../../photos/LiveblogImage/7517.jpg" width="620" height="250" title="Lanc Lads 2" alt="Lanc Lads 2"  /></a><br /></div>
<p></p>
<p>Just getting comfortable at VBar, a little too comfortable I reckon.</p>
<p><strong>09:41</strong> Have just seen a blonde Fred Flintstone looking a little lost in Vanburgh, maybe he played last night and just doesn&#039;t quite know what to do after the hammering that Lancaster took in the <strong>Rugby Men&#039;s Firsts</strong> at Huntington Stadium!</p>
<p><strong>09:40</strong> </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../photos/full/7516.jpg"><img src="../../photos/LiveblogImage/7516.jpg" width="620" height="250" title="Lanc Lads" alt="Lanc Lads"  /></a><br /></div>
<p></p>
<p>Lancaster lads&#039; usual attire? Smashing? Or plain smashed?</p>
<p><strong>09:39</strong> Just a quick reminder of what Roses Saturday has in store for us. We have <strong>table tennis, hockey, squash, water sports, fencing, lacrosse, volleyball, rowing (highlight of the day)</strong> and of course the one that you&#039;ve all been wanting to see and an event which should see people flock to it in their thousands... the <strong>debating</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>09:26</strong> And we&#039;re off as the <strong>Table Tennis Mixed 2nds and 1sts</strong> get ready to kick start Roses Saturday 2011</p>
<p><strong>09:25</strong> James is a big fan of the bacon and sausage sandwiches in Vanburgh this morning!</p>
<p><strong>09:20</strong> Seems to be a little bit of a lull in action as we wait for Roses Saturday to get under way. Just heard some of the Lancaster girls say that they &quot;don&#039;t want to play because they are too tired&quot;. Too much moaning for my liking!</p>
<p><strong>09:14</strong> Lizzy comments that there are &quot;lots of squeaky shoe sounds on linoleum, but the <strong>Table Tennis Mixed 1sts and 2nds</strong> are still practising&quot;</p>
<p><strong>09:09</strong> Chiifen is now on a scouting mission to take photos of said Lancaster students... that&#039;s got to be worth sticking around for...right?</p>
<p><strong>09:07</strong> Loving the fact that there seem to be <strong>a lot</strong> of very dreary, slightly funny, VERY hungover looking Lancaster students aimlessly wandering around Vanburgh this morning!!</p>
<p><strong>09:05</strong> Although Lizzy thinks they look odd with their tiny racquets! Awww...</p>
<p><strong>09:05</strong> Deputy Editor Lizzy Pennock is now reporting on <strong> Table Tennis Mixed 2nds and 1sts </strong> from the Dance Studio. Apparently the Lancaster lads are quite beefy! Hubba hubba!</p>
<p><strong>08:55</strong> Morning everyone (from James, who is clearly not as efficient at making it to Vanburgh for 8.30 as Chiifen and Lizzy!). Massive day in Roses 2011 today, 129 points to play for if my maths is correct. It&#039;s make or break for the White Rose, <strong>COME ON YORK!!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>08:52</strong> This just in: &quot;Blonde Lancaster boys diss York University!&quot; No way....</p>
<p><strong>08:35</strong> Editor and Deputy Editor Chiifen and Lizzy are camped out at Vanbrugh JCR at the moment listening to the not so melodious singing voices of the Lancaster lads. Shhhhh boys it&#039;s too early!</p>
<p><strong>08:13</strong> Good morning York!</p>

<p>When did we start winning? Totally missed that but woo! I guess.  Also, agree with #1 that these videos really make this blog ace! Well done guys.  And for covering the Badminton - I can&#039;t see any of that on Nouse at the moment...</p>
