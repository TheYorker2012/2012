        <p><strong>Day six of the World Cup 2010 offered exciting football from Chile, favourites Spain suffered a shock defeat in their opening game and Uruguay won in superb fashion to top Group A.</strong></p>
<p>The early kick-off of the day saw Honduras take on Chile in what turned out to be a thrilling match. Hondurans were allowed to turn up for school or work two hours later than usual so they could watch their team compete in the World Cup for the first time since 1982, but with seven members of the team only playing professional football part-time, Honduras were the clear underdogs. Chile dominated the game and, playing in an uncommon 3-3-1-3 formation, they baffled the Honduras team with one-touch passing and quick movement.</p>
<p>Right winger Sanchez was particularly delightful to watch, running circles around the Honduras defenders, as Chile made attack after attack. Honduras&rsquo; goalkeeper Valladares was responsible for keeping the score level, pulling off some great saves from free-kicks and long-range efforts. Chile eventually took the lead in the 34th minute when Beausejour&rsquo;s effort deflected off a defender into the back of the net. It was an unlucky goal for the helpless defender but gave Chile the lead they deserved after their dominance and good play. There were huge shouts from the Chileans for a penalty just before half time but it was waved away by the referee. Honduras created few chances and gave the Chilean goalkeeper little to do.</p>
<p>The second half continued in the same fashion and it seemed inevitable that Chile would increase their lead. However, two spectacular chances inside the box were missed and the Honduran keeper Valladares made a fantastic save to ensure his team&rsquo;s goal difference didn&rsquo;t decrease anymore. The game finished 1-0 to Chile and was a fantastic opener to Group H, piling the pressure on Spain and Switzerland.</p>
<p>The next game of the day was Spain versus Switzerland, with an easy win expected for Spain, the World Cup favourites and Euro 2008 Champions. However, the match turned out to be the first major upset of the tournament as underdogs Switzerland pulled off a shocking 1-0 victory. Spain started well and enjoyed the majority of the possession and chances, hardly allowing Switzerland a touch of the ball. It didn&rsquo;t look to be Switzerland&rsquo;s day as Senderos limped off with a foot injury after a collision with his own team-mate.</p>
<p>However, despite their dominance, Spain failed to score, with Sergio Ramos putting a great chance wide and Iniesta firing straight at Swiss keeper Benaglio, and the teams went in 0-0 at half time. Spain dominated the opening of the second half but their misses proved costly as Switzerland took the lead in the 52nd minute, capitalising on sloppy defending. A long ball was collected by Eren Derdiyok and, as defenders threw in mistimed tackles all around him, he skipped into the penalty area and the ball was bundled to Fernandes, who lifted it easily over Spanish goalkeeper Casillas to give Switzerland a 1-0 lead. Spanish defender Pique received a head injury in the goal build-up, but the goal stood despite Spanish protestations.</p>
<p>Fernando Torres, Jesus Navas and Pedro were all brought on as Spain, visibly shocked, tried to turn the game around. A stunning strike from Xabi Alonso smashed into the crossbar and Jesus Navas created some brilliant attacks but Spain couldn&rsquo;t find a way through the strong Swiss defence. Torres, recovering from knee surgery, had several chances to score but didn&rsquo;t look at his sharpest. Switzerland were unlucky not to make it 2-0 when Derdiyok&rsquo;s shot bounced back off the post but one goal was enough to give them a historic first-ever win over Spain.</p>
<p>Uruguay&rsquo;s match against South Africa saw Diego Forlan become the current highest scorer of the competition as he scored two goals and set up a third in Uruguay&rsquo;s impressive 3-0 victory over hosts South Africa. South Africa fielded the same team that drew 1-1 with Mexico in the opening match of the tournament but they were unable to provide any great threat to their opponents. Uruguay looked much more impressive than they did in their 0-0 opener against France and bombarded the South African goal with attack after attack. Striker Suarez had the best chances to put Uruguay ahead but could only hit the side netting with his first attempt and then fired straight at keeper Khune from 20 yards out.</p>
<p>Uruguay&rsquo;s first goal came in the 24th minute when Forlan&rsquo;s strike from 30 yards deflected off defender Mokoena and dipped over the South African goalkeeper. Despite numerous attacks, Uruguay didn&rsquo;t score again until they won a penalty with ten minutes to go, which saw South Africa&rsquo;s keeper Khune receive a red card for his mistimed tackle. Forlan kept calm whilst new keeper Josephs was subbed on and then stepped up and fired an excellent penalty high into the top of the net to double Uruguay&rsquo;s lead and secure the three points. Shortly after, South African fans started streaming out of the stadium and by the end of the match the stands were only half full.</p>
<p>Alvaro Pereira added a third goal deep in the five minutes of stoppage time to round off a fantastic team performance. South Africa mustered a few weak attempts during the match but Tshabalala fired well wide and Mphela missed two close-range headers, summing up a dismal display for the hosts. Uruguay now top Group A with four points and can be fairly confident of qualification for the next stage as they go into their last match against Mexico and they may just have ended the host&rsquo;s dream of progressing further in the competition.</p>
