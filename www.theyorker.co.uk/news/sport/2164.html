				Sned - The Undisputed Heavyweight Champion of Gambling			</div>
				<div class="Date">Friday, 24th October 2008</div>
		<div class="Author">

		</div>
		<div class="SubText">So The Yorker betting boys are back in town, did you miss us? Of course you did. Did you have a good summer without us? Of course you did. Did you win any money without our magical tipping ability? Of course you didn&#039;t.</div>

        <p><strong>Sned&#039;s Sure Things</strong></p>
<p>1pt win, <strong>Henrythenavigator</strong>, Breeder&#039;s Cup Classic, at 7-1 (Coral).</p>
<p>1pt win, England v Papua New Guinea, <strong>England to win by 16-20 points</strong>, at 9-1 (Coral).</p>
<p>1pt win, <strong>Middlesex</strong> to beat England, at 2-1 (Ladbrokes).</p>
<p>1pt win, Torquay v Chipstead, double result <strong>Draw/Torquay</strong>, at 7-2 (Ladbrokes).</p>
<p>2pt win, Everton v Man U, <strong>Rooney</strong> to score first, at 9-2 (Coral).</p>
<p>The Rugby League World cup has hardly got the nation abuzz with anticipation but it all kicks off tomorrow. England play the sporting heavyweights of Papua New Guinea, a country which has 850 indigenous languages, the same number of points that many would expect England to stick past them.</p>
<p>PNG do however have a bit of a class as well as a lot of rough and tumble and rugby league is their national sport. Apparently it serves as a replacement for tribal warfare which would explain some of the tackles members of the squad have made in recent matches.</p>
<p>With all the rough comes the diamond that is Stanley Gene, a real celebrity in PNG. Gene has played in the Super League for many years now but still no-one has a clue how old he is. Estimates range from 32 to the quite ridiculous 58, how could a 58 year old run about like that? My estimate of the winning margin is a little lower being between 16 and 20.</p>
<p>Continuing the international theme, an event which has got the nation excited, and the cricket WAGS even more excited, is the Stanford Twenty20. A billionaire who openly hates test cricket has bowled it into Lords (his helicopter landing on the Nursery square) and slapped 20 million dollars on the table of the long room and said &lsquo;lets play&rsquo;. Quite frankly any cricketer worth his salt has wanted to play along with each winning player getting one million dollars.</p>
<p>What would you do with ONE MILLION DOLLARS? The clever amongst you would invest much of it in this column while those who are even cleverer wouldn&rsquo;t.  Before the big money match comes the Stanford series which pits England against Middlesex, the English Twenty20 champions. Will England&rsquo;s minds be on it? Would you care about a match if you knew that a few days later you were going to be playing in a potentially life changing match? I personally would just make sure that I didn&rsquo;t get injured so I&rsquo;m going to back Middlesex.</p>
<p>Back to football and isn&rsquo;t Wazza Rooney in fine form?  It&rsquo;s his birthday today and he could score his 100th goal of his career tomorrow at the place where he started his career in spectacular fashion by beating Seaman from 30 yards all those years ago. Surely he will, surely someone has written the script for that one.</p>
<p>Staying with football and many of you may think it weird that I&rsquo;m betting on Torquay v Chipstead in the fourth round F.A Cup qualifying, but there is method behind the madness. York University&rsquo;s own Dom O&rsquo;Shea is a Chipstead player so will be playing (injury permitting) in front of 2000+ west country fans.</p>
<p>It would be a huge shock if they were to get anything but a thumping from Plainmoor but the double result gives decent value. Back Dom and his boys to be level at half-time but then to lose, fitness will be a major difference as Torquay are a professional outfit. GOOD LUCK DOM!</p>
<p><strong>Seano&#039;s Snaps</strong></p>
<p><em>Writen by Sean Martin</em></p>
<p>Buy 1/2pt, <strong>Obama Electoral College Votes</strong> at 342 (Sporting Index)</p>
<p>1pt win, <strong>Jukebox Jury</strong> aat 4.7 Doncaster 15.35 Saturday (Betfair)</p>
<p>1pt, <strong>Australia</strong> at 13/1 to win series vs India (Betfair)</p>
<p>2pt, <strong>Sunderland</strong> to beat Newcastle at 2.26 (Betfair)</p>
<p>2pt Lay, <strong>Tottenham vs Bolton</strong> at 2.1 (Betfair)</p>
<p>Whether old or new your student loan is in and the wisdom of my self and Sned is the best way to waste invest it. Here are my selections to get your term off to a winning start which should fund that new entrance fee to Salvation.</p>
<p>The recent surge in the polling seems to show that McCain has had it. Don&rsquo;t go backing Obama at 1.15 as even if you did have the capital to make it worthwhile, it&rsquo;s not worth the risk of assassination. Instead look to spread betting where Obama has created &ldquo;change we can believe in&rdquo; on the Electoral College Votes markets (ECV). I think the buy at 342 is value as McCain voters will begin to stay at home rather than vote for a lost cause and undecideds look to back a winner.</p>
<p>Real Clear Politics&rsquo; state by state voting shows Obama currently on 364 with no toss up states: this will only get bigger. Remember with spread betting there is no fixed stake and you can lose more than you put on. I expect around a 25 point win (if you placed &pound;1 a point you would win &pound;25) at least but stay cautious at &frac12; a point to be sure.</p>
<p>The racing tip this week is Jukebox Jury who is running 2f for the Racing Post trophy at Doncaster. Jockey Royston Ffrench has won on him before at Ascot and the resemblance of their successful partnership should make 4.7 value on Saturday.</p>
<p>Cricket lovers over the world were shocked by India&rsquo;s spanking of Australia this week by over 300 runs. It appears though that the punters have got carried away on the Indian bandwagon and put up Australia at a large 13/1 to win the next two games and therefore the series.</p>
<p>Ok, they were poor in the Mohali test, but this is a team that has won the ICC test championship 7 times since its inception and cannot be counted out. The Delhi pitch has been relayed with &lsquo;mitti&rsquo; grass in it to try to ensure a result, and will give pace and bounce which the Aussie seam strength needs, making 14 whopping value.</p>
<p>Since their premiership comeback Sunderland have performed well against their rivals Newcastle, and their price of 2.26 this weekend seems top value. Newcastle have had 4 losses and only 2 draws in their last 6 outings, as their backroom fiasco continues. A new look Sunderland with the prolific Cisse up front will take Kinnear&rsquo;s lads to Toon.</p>
<p>Now we come to a subject close to my heart, my dear old Tottenham Hotspur. Having been barraged with the entire triangle, speeding and anything that has 3 points as the punch line, jokes this week, I can&rsquo;t see where our next point is coming from.</p>
<p>Consequently I have to bite the bullet and say that the lay of Spurs at 2.1 to win at home to Bolton is too good to miss. Bolton have had a shaky start but a confident 3-1 win away to West Ham has seen them already gain success in London this season. With Corluka injured and Bale suspended Spurs are in for a tough ride over the coming weeks. Although it hurts me to say it, Bolton are a better side currently</p>
