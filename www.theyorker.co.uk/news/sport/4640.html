        <p><strong>08:13</strong> Good morning York!</p>
<p><strong>21:08</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Darts Women <strong>2-7</strong></p>
<p><strong>21:05</strong> It seems a bit quiet now, even for the library. I reckon <span class="theyorker">the Yorker</span> team is about to call it a night! It&#039;s been a pleasure blogging for you! Hope you found us mildly entertaining and somewhat informative!</p>
<p>Yorker love! Peace.</p>
<p><strong>20:56</strong> Update on pool!</p>
<p>Women&#039;s 6-0 to Lancaster
Men&#039;s 4-1 to Lancaster</p>
<p><strong>20:32</strong> Only men&#039;s darts and pool left now folks. Good times these are, sitting in the library all by myself. Reminds me of an article on <span class="theyorker">the yorker</span> I once read, something about meeting someone to date at the library? Well, where are you Romeo?</p>
<p><strong>20:28</strong> Frisbee: Half a minute left and York scores !! And it&#039;s over. 10-9 to Lancaster. Close one though.</p>
<p><strong>20:26</strong> One minute left in frisbee and Lancaster scores again!</p>
<p><strong>20:26</strong> Darts women final score York 2 Lancaster 7.</p>
<p><strong>20:25</strong> Indoor frisbee: 9-7 to Lancaster! Crowd is going wild and is entirely in favour of Lancaster. Can I just say, home ground advantage?</p>
<p><strong>20:23</strong> Just a recap on pool:</p>
<p>Women&#039;s 5-0 to Lancaster
Men&#039;s 4-0 to Lancaster.</p>
<p>All in all, well done York!!</p>
<p><strong>20:20</strong> Well well, ye of little faith (by ye I mean me), York has taken the lead with 7-6 to us in indoor frisbee!</p>
<p><strong>20:19</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Indoor Frisbee Mixed <strong>5-9</strong></p>
<p><strong>20:17</strong> York frisbee team fight to the end (of the day), 6-6! And time-out now! Come on, the suspense is killing even me!</p>
<p><strong>20:16</strong> In men&#039;s pool, Lancaster won 3-0 York. No surprise on my part. Sorry guys.</p>
<p><strong>20:14</strong> And the fast-paced frisbee game has become 6-4 to Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>20:13</strong> I seem to have mixed up the equestrian score earlier! York 1st and 2nd teams placed 4th and 3rd respectively, leaving the top spots for Lancaster! Perhaps it was too much wishful thinking on my part!</p>
<p><strong>20:10</strong> Lancaster score once again. 4-2. Hmm, I&#039;m losing interest!</p>
<p><strong>20:09</strong> Another score for Lancaster. 3-2</p>
<p><strong>20:08</strong> Lancaster score! 2-1! York score! 2-2! This is shaping up to be an exciting game!</p>
<p><strong>20:08</strong> Another injury in frisbee! York player faceplants twice in a row and seems to have hurt himself. I thought frisbee was a non-contact sport!</p>
<p><strong>20:04</strong> Bless my words, 1-1 !</p>
<p><strong>20:03</strong> Ah but the universe has its way of balancing itself out, 1-0 to Lancaster. Dear universe, where is York&#039;s karma?</p>
<p><strong>20:02</strong> Breaking news! Lancastrian girl gets hit in the eye by frisbee.</p>
<p><strong>19:55</strong> Lancaster have officially won women darts 5-2.</p>
<p><strong>19:54</strong> That was the practice session folks, by the way! Main team warming up now. Lancaster sporting all men, while York has two women and one man with long hair.</p>
<p><strong>19:53</strong> Lancaster has won mixed frisbee 9-5. this is quite disheartening !</p>
<p><strong>19:47</strong> York is trailing behind in women&#039;s pool, with Lancaster leading 4-0.</p>
<p><strong>19:45</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Badminton Mixed <strong>8-1</strong></p>
<p><strong>19:44</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Equestrian 1st Team <strong>4-60</strong></p>
<p><strong>19:42</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Equestrian 2nd Team <strong>44-47</strong></p>
<p><strong>19:42</strong> The results are in for this morning&#039;s equestrian! York&#039;s 1st and 2nd team both won, with a whopping 60-4 win for 1st team and a close 47-44 win for 2nd team. Well done guys!</p>
<p><strong>19:40</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Swimming Women <strong>34-76</strong></p>
<p><strong>19:40</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Swimming Men <strong>48-64</strong></p>
<p><strong>19:38</strong> No news anywhere, ladila, the library is a lonely place. No wonder I don&#039;t usually go there.</p>
<p><strong>19:25</strong> Grace has confirmed that it has been a practice session for frisbee! Just as well, because the score now stands at 4 - 3 to Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>19:20</strong> Grace is still debating with herself about whether this is the actual game. Let&#039;s find out!</p>
<p><strong>19:19</strong> Snowboarders have losr a race! That&#039;s okay though, because YUSnow still brings home 10 points!</p>
<p><strong>19:19</strong> Mixed indoor frisbee: One point to Lancaster, 2-1.</p>
<p><strong>19:16</strong> York seems to be doing well at frisbee, currently leading 2-0. Although Grace has just informed me that this might just be practice. Typical.</p>
<p><strong>19:15</strong> Lancaster takes the lead in darts, making it 3-2 to Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>19:14</strong> York takes the lead in mixed indoor frisbee. Strong smell of cheetos in the viewing gallery, hmm, hungry anyone?</p>
<p>York lead 1-0</p>
<p><strong>19:12</strong> And the results for the relay are in! Lancaster won both women and men (surprise surprise).</p>
<p>76-34 girls and 64-48 guys to Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>19:11</strong> No a Lancastarian girl has a backwards cap on. Clearly too many frisbees to the head, or is this Lancastrian fashion?</p>
<p><strong>19:10</strong> Back in the main sports hall, indoor frisbee players have warmed up. According to Grace, doing a decent job of making frisbee look cool too! York seem to be in worse shape than Lancaster, as per usual today.</p>
<p>One Lancastrian boy is wearing a backwards cap, which seems to puzzle Grace.</p>
<p>Prize to who can tell her why!</p>
<p><strong>19:08</strong> Lancaster badminton captain Jonathan Holland told <span class="theyorker">the yorker</span>,&quot; Absolutely delighted with that win. Credits to York, they made it very tough. And all the better to have been personally involved in that final match. Very very happy! RAAA!!!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>19:07</strong> Only 2 relays left. Lancaster seem confident about who will win, so are we really.</p>
<p><strong>19:06</strong> Harriet&#039;s bidding the liveblog goodbye and good luck for the rest of the events this evening - and would just like to say she thinks Chiifen is an absolute saint! xx</p>
<p><strong>19:06</strong> Amy has just given us the inside scoop on snow sports! Ladies skiers were amazing, and have &quot;totally beat Lancaster&quot;. 4 points for York. (We definitely need that!)</p>
<p>Snowboarders had a slow start with the first run being a draw, and a rerun- also a draw. They then proceeded to win 2 races and take home another 4 points for York!</p>
<p>York mixed skiers have won 2 races so far, but might have to stop due to time constraints. At the moment it looks as if we&#039;re taking home 12 points !</p>
<p>Snowsports might just be York&#039;s saving grace!</p>
<p><strong>19:04</strong> I&#039;m still not happy about these numbers.</p>
<p><strong>19:01</strong> Lancaster have also won 100m womens and mens front crawl. By miles.</p>
<p><strong>19:00</strong> Lancaster&#039;s Paul Heeney and Jonny Holland win badminton men&#039;s 2nd 21-16. Overall score for badminton&#039;s men&#039;s 2nds is Lancaster 5 - 4 York.</p>
<p><strong>19:00</strong> I have a flyer here for Lancaster&#039;s &quot;One Big Sunday&quot; club night.  I have to say it doesn&#039;t look a patch on SNG</p>
<p><strong>18:59</strong> After a crushing final set, Lancaster claims victory in Badminton men&#039;s 2nds!</p>
<p><strong>18:59</strong> And women&#039;s breaststroke 100m goes to Lancaster again! They&#039;ve also come in 1st and 3rd in the mens.</p>
<p><strong>18:58</strong> No, I reckon I jinxed it.</p>
<p><strong>18:56</strong> A much welcome award of 4 points for York from the Snowboarding!  Dare I say things are looking up?</p>
<p><strong>18:55</strong> Lancaster is on a winning streak ! The 100 m men&#039;s butterfly and the backstroke are in their bag.</p>
<p><strong>18:52</strong> In the first mixed race of the Skiing, York take an easy victory</p>
<p><strong>18:51</strong> Lancaster currently leading by 1 for men&#039;s pool and by 2 for women&#039;s pool.</p>
<p><strong>18:49</strong> It&#039;s getting quiet here in the Lancaster library, and Becky Ellis suspects the swimming could go on for A LOT longer</p>
<p><strong>18:48</strong> Things aren&#039;t looking up for York this year. Oh dear.</p>
<p><strong>18:47</strong> The girls are back in the water with 100m butterfly. Lancaster girls are both finished long before either York girls.</p>
<p><strong>18:45</strong> Tension rises in the badminton hall.</p>
<p><strong>18:45</strong> Badminton men&#039;s 2nds. Lancaster take the first end. One step closer to victory and the two crucial points!</p>
<p><strong>18:44</strong> Darts women now stand at York 2 - 1 Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>18:44</strong> Lancaster has just won one darts game, close though!</p>
<p><strong>18:40</strong> Tensest badminton life of Tom&#039;s life apparently.Every point is being cheered and jeered at !</p>
<p><strong>18:38</strong> It&#039;s 4-4 in the Men&#039;s 2nd badminton, with one match left to decide the outcome. All York&#039;s hopes rest on captain James Somerside and president Andrew Robert, who have yet to win today.</p>
<p><strong>18:37</strong> And so they did. An interval now.</p>
<p><strong>18:36</strong> Men&#039;s relay is closer but Lancaster is probably going to win this one too.</p>
<p><strong>18:34</strong> Men&#039;s <strong>pool</strong> have started with an intense match between York&#039;s Hogg and Lancaster&#039;s Stone.</p>
<p><strong>18:34</strong> 50m mens breaststroke, womens front crawl and mens front crawl all go to Lancaster. Women&#039;s relay, and Lancaster take an easy lead. Someone in the crowd thinks York should just give up now. Well I suppose Lancaster did just win that one too...</p>
<p><strong>18:31</strong> York has won the second game of <strong>darts</strong>! wooh!</p>
<p><strong>18:26</strong> Rogers beat our Palmer 2-1.</p>
<p><strong>18:26</strong> Mens 50m backstroke. Lancaster win. Girls 50m breaststroke. Close. But Lancaster win again.</p>
<p><strong>18:25</strong> And <strong>pool</strong> is underway! Women&#039;s pool is won by Lancaster&#039;s Rogers. Come on York, shape up!</p>
<p><strong>18:25</strong> Men&#039;s badminton 2nds STILL going on. Tom says the tension is killing him and he just wants it to be over. Sounds painful.</p>
<p><strong>18:24</strong> And the 50m womens backstroke is won by Lancaster, with shouts of &quot;Go on Sue&quot;. From Lancaster I think.</p>
<p><strong>18:22</strong> The men&#039;s 50m butterfly has gone to Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>18:18</strong> York has played and conquered one round of darts! Good stuff.</p>
<p><strong>18:17</strong> Everyone&#039;s heading back to the pool area and the swimmers are warming up again. Must be nippy in those Speedos.</p>
<p><strong>18:13</strong> People are wandering around in swimsuits waiting for swimming to restart in a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>18:11</strong> Badminton, Men&#039;s 2nds still at 3-3 and the atmosphere is tense as hell.</p>
<p><strong>18:07</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Judo Mens Under 90kg <strong>0-10</strong></p>

<p><strong>18:03</strong> They&#039;ve cleared the pool and suspended the races. Hopefully the girl is alright.</p>
<p><strong>18:03</strong> Judo scores take Lancaster up to <strong>26.5 - 11.5</strong> lead overall. Bad times.</p>
<p><strong>18:02</strong> One York girl seems to be having a panic or asthma attack of some kind and had to be pulled out the pool... Oh dear.</p>
<p><strong>18:02</strong> Women for backstroke now in and Lancaster is in the lead. Lancaster wins the men&#039;s medley though York wasn&#039;t far behind.</p>
<p><strong>18:00</strong> The men&#039;s swimming is closer, one of the Lancastrians is leading. The crowd have been told off for being too loud at the beginning of races.</p>
<p><strong>17:59</strong> make that 3-3 for the seconds - the tension is racking up!</p>
<p><strong>17:58</strong> Mixed badminton is over and the points are all York&#039;s! Having won five games out of 9 Lancaster cannot come back, so York get 4 big juicy Roses points. The matches continue, but there&#039;s only pride at stake now. Meanwhile the Men&#039;s 2nds are 3-2 up and only need one more victory, but are really struggling against a resurgent Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>17:58</strong> Judo is over apparently. Harriet isn&#039;t too sure, perhaps distracted by the referee?</p>
<p>Women&#039;s under 57 has been withdrawn. Withdrawn? Anyone care to tell me what that means?</p>
<p><strong>17:51</strong> And in plunge the guys, two from York and two from Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>17:49</strong> Over in swimming, the York girl is half a length behind the other two. And Lancaster won the other race.</p>
<p><strong>17:48</strong> Maybe throwing people around is fun? Well aren&#039;t we just a little sadistic. Harriet&#039;s developing a mini crush on the referee!</p>
<p><strong>17:47</strong> Though I do think Lancaster has an unfair advantage in actually OWNING a swimming pool.</p>
<p><strong>17:47</strong> The girls are in the swimming pool and York is lagging behind already...</p>
<p><strong>17:45</strong> Happy faces all around the minor sports hall where judo took place. Not quite sure why?</p>
<p><strong>17:43</strong> In the men&#039;s 2nds in Badminton, Lancaster&#039;s Sunny Wong and Papa Oppong-Frempong win a final game 23-21 to win 2-1, beating York&#039;s captain James Somerside and president Andy Robert. Amazing names AND victory? God isn&#039;t supposed to give with both hands...</p>
<p><strong>17:39</strong> Here&#039;s the recap for <strong>judo</strong>, just in case like me you are finding this all very confusing.</p>
<p>York won under 81 male and over 57 female.</p>
<p>York forfeited over and under 90 male.</p>
<p>Lancaster won under 73 male.</p>
<p>Congrats to the winners!</p>
<p><strong>17:37</strong> The pool&#039;s beginning to empty, hopefully it&#039;ll all begin soon. There are whistles blowing, not sure what for though...</p>
<p><strong>17:37</strong> Ah but York bags Men&#039;s under 81 kg and women&#039;s over 57 kg! Boo-yah!</p>
<p><strong>17:37</strong> York continue to rack up victories in the badminton, the men winning 3-1 and the mixed pairs 4-0 ahead so on the verge of clinching four vital Roses points!</p>
<p><strong>17:36</strong> So the Lancastrian swimmers, not content with lycra, have gone for red and black stripes on their faces which are rubbing off now they&#039;re in the water. Their supporters have really gone for it with the themed costumes, one girl has a red handprint on her chest... classy</p>
<p>...some traditional Lancastrian names on display as well, another girl&#039;s gone for &quot;poke hole&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>17:35</strong> And first round of Judo goes to Lancaster 4-1!</p>
<p><strong>17:32</strong> <strong>Judo</strong> women&#039;s match looks tense with the current one all score !</p>
<p><strong>17:28</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Frisbee Open <strong>11-15</strong></p>
<p><strong>17:25</strong> Lancaster booing York - not so sportmanlike!</p>
<p><strong>17:24</strong> Swimmers beginning to warm up in the pool now...</p>
<p><strong>17:23</strong> It seems Lancaster need to win just one match to get best of 5 as we&#039;ve already forfeited 2.</p>
<p><strong>17:22</strong> First judo, 5 matches! Bad news for York, 2 of our contestants might not have turned up.</p>
<p><strong>17:14</strong> The Lancaster swimmers appear to be getting ready with war paint!</p>
<p><strong>17:07</strong> Warming up for judo, Harriet&#039;s feeling nostalgic, believe it or not she used to do judo! Impressive! Boys, don&#039;t mess !</p>
<p><strong>17:06</strong> James Hor and Liz McFadden have won their opening match 2-1 as well. Looks like badminton could be York&#039;s chance to close the gap...</p>
<p><strong>16:59</strong> Harriet has just informed me she is the only female reporter there, see <span class="theyorker">the yorker</span> is all about gender equality!</p>
<p><strong>16:57</strong> <strong>Judo</strong> time! Just putting out the mats in the minor sports hall. Think some of thesejudokas look a bit scruffy, but they&#039;re all helping. Mm, very sportsmanlike!</p>
<p><strong>16:50</strong> A flurry of successes on the badminton front: the first pair of the men&#039;s 2nds, Gatenby and Hirst, won 2-1 and the second pair of men&#039;s 2nds, Tahir Shettey and Chris Ashley have won their first match 2-0. Laura Suddaby and James Davies have also won the 3rds mixed match to get things off to a solid York start.</p>
<p><strong>16:34</strong> Men 2nds Badminton has started with the 1st pairs playing each other. York&#039;s Tom gatenby and Adam Hirst are raining down the smashes but they can&#039;t quite cope with Johan Simm&#039;s crosscourt backhand.</p>
<p><strong>16:32</strong> Big thanks go to Chris Travis for his additional bit of magic he has put on <span class="theyorker">The Yorker</span>&#039;s Roses coverage. Hopefully everything will work smoother from now on!</p>
<p><strong>16:29</strong> Ah, the Badminton score&#039;s currently at 5-5 - looking slightly better than our prospects earlier today.</p>
<p><strong>16:27</strong> For the first time in a long while the phones are silent.</p>
<p><strong>16:26</strong> I must say, whatever happens in the sport, the Lancaster library has one up on ours - it isn&#039;t filled with contractors trying to remove asbestos and suchlike.  It&#039;s rather refreshing really.</p>
<p><strong>16:24</strong> Spectators in the Sports Hall are getting ready for the Badminton, which should be starting sometime soon.</p>
<p><strong>15:50</strong> York Men&#039;s Hockey 1sts Captain Andy Harris: &#039;Really tense game, very hard fought. We didn&#039;t give up and kept going to the end to get the win we deserved.&#039;</p>
<p><strong>15:40</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Indoor Hockey Mens 1st <strong>5-3</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:39</strong> York have won the Men&#039;s 1st Hockey! sealing it 5 - 3 with a final short corner from Nick Latchan. 2 points to York! And a smiley face from our reporter. :)</p>
<p><strong>15:36</strong> But York are being hard pressed in defence.</p>
<p><strong>15:35</strong> Lancaster pull one back but it&#039;s disallowed so 4 - 3 it stands.</p>
<p><strong>15:34</strong> York with a golden chance to get both points with a short corner but it goes wanting. But then York grab a fourth goal and move into the lead for the first time in the match.</p>
<p><strong>15:29</strong> Nick Latchman nails a short corner with an absolutely superb strike and then James Brenton adds another to bring it back to 3 -3. The atmosphere is really buzzing now!</p>
<p><strong>15:26</strong> This is real end to end stuff, and Lancaster score again through Callum Hollis to extend their lead 3 - 1.</p>
<p><strong>15:24</strong> York fight back with a series of short corners but stil can&#039;t beat the keeper.</p>
<p><strong>15:21</strong> Lancaster score IMMEDIATELY from the restart. A great run from Phil Schacht finished superbly to make it 2 - 1.</p>
<p><strong>15:20</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_draw.png" alt="Draw" /> <strong>Draw!</strong> Indoor Hockey Womens 1st <strong>1-1</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:16</strong> Half time and it&#039;s 1-1. A tense second half to follow.</p>
<p><strong>15:14</strong> York equalise through the bespectacled Niko Bode when the keeper is caught out of position after blocking a York attack.</p>
<p><strong>15:12</strong> Hockey president Rob Newton is making some good chances but Lancaster&#039;s keeper is equal to them. Lancaster shoot wide from a corner shot. 1-0 it remains.</p>
<p><strong>15:10</strong> Lancaster&#039;s Jack Keating scores an excellent goal from a tight angle to make it 1 - 0 to the hosts. And York miss two good chances to equalise from short corners.</p>
<p><strong>15:09</strong> At the moment its a master class in keeping at both ends.</p>
<p><strong>15:09</strong> Here we go - cagey start from York and quickly concede a penalty after a defender blocked the ball with his feet in the D. Fortunatly Lancaster&#039;s Klein hits the post and York survive.</p>
<p><strong>15:06</strong> York Men 1sts - As in the football the men&#039;s 1sts are York&#039;s last chance to get a win. In BUCS, although York are a league above Lancaster, Lancaster have had a brilliant season and have been promoted.</p>
<p><strong>14:44</strong> Another goal disallowed - so the match ends on 1-1.  York scored with a short corner in the final hit of the game, but it was out of time.</p>
<p><strong>14:38</strong> York just can&#039;t break down the Lancaster defense in the sports hall, despite having a high level of possession.</p>
<p>GOAL - short corner by Laura Pepper takes York to 2-1</p>
<p><strong>14:34</strong> Apparently the game is getting fairly heated.</p>
<p><strong>14:33</strong> Womens firsts - 1-1.  And York doing better in the second half.
And a York goal disallowed in the Womens too.</p>
<p><strong>14:31</strong> Final word on *that* goal - (Mens seconds) - disallowed, so the scores stay level.</p>
<p><strong>14:30</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_draw.png" alt="Draw" /> <strong>Draw!</strong> Indoor Hockey Mens 2nd <strong>2-2</strong></p>
<p><strong>14:27</strong> Oooh! Controversy - in the Mens Seconds Hockey, a York goal was disallowed... yet the Hockey Club are claiming photographic evidence of it&#039;s legality.  Intriguing.</p>
<p><strong>14:25</strong> It&#039;s quiet here in the Lancaster campus library, and I have to say, I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m reporting on a sporting tournament.</p>
<p><strong>14:22</strong> It&#039;s half time in the Hockey, and the score is 1-1 with Lancaster on top.  York will be glad of the break.</p>
<p><strong>14:20</strong> Lancaster equalise in the women&#039;s 2nds hockey to make the score 1-1.</p>
<p><strong>14:18</strong> York short corner given for very physical challenge from the centre of the pitch, but now York are on the back foot again.  Still 1-0</p>
<p><strong>14:13</strong> Good stuff - York&#039;s Imy Eldergill scores to make it 1-0</p>
<p><strong>14:08</strong> Shockingly, our correspondent in the main hall informs us that things are actually AHEAD of schedule.</p>
<p><strong>14:06</strong> Women&#039;s Firsts Hockey warming up now - and the teams look to be very evenly matched, based on BUCS.  York are a league below, but have had a much better season, losing just one of their ten games.  In contrast, Lancaster have suffered five defeats.</p>
<p>The &quot;famous&quot; Henry James Foy is here watching this match, I wonder how much of a celebrity he is over here?</p>
<p><strong>14:00</strong> Lancaster snatch back a goal from a short corner, and the match ends on 2 all, giving each team half a point each.</p>
<p><strong>13:49</strong> Apparently some fantastic defending from Joe Walsh out there today, and excellent keeping from Tom Chewins as well - keeping York securely in charge of this game. Good luck, lads.</p>
<p><strong>13:46</strong> There are 42 points still up for grabs today, and Tom Fitz-Hugh predicts that Lancaster will end the day ahead by half a dozen or so.</p>
<p><strong>13:44</strong> York has started the second-half of the Men&#039;s hockey with boring possession play, but who can blame them when the overall score stands at 18-6.  Every point counts today, as York try to haul back the 12 point deficit incurred by forfeited rowing.</p>
<p><strong>13:36</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Frisbee Open <strong>11-15</strong></p>
<p><strong>13:36</strong> And it&#039;s not raining, that&#039;s always good</p>
<p><strong>13:35</strong> Men&#039;s 2nds Hockey at half time, and York are comfortable at 3-1 up.  Yay!</p>
<p><strong>13:34</strong> Harriet here. And we are finally online! (on a pc that is)  This has made me ridiculously happy.</p>
<p><strong>13:31</strong> Lancaster&#039;s Ian Fletcher strikes back to make it 2-1 to York. A third short corner and a third york goal. This time Michael Giblin nets making it 3-1 York.</p>
<p><strong>13:30</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Lancaster wins the outdoor frisbee <strong>15-11</strong></p>
<p><strong>13:27</strong> Again York are a BUCR league below Lancaster in the men&#039;s hockey 2nds so the hosts are favourites, but York score first through a powerful Mark Homan shot. And massive deja vu a minute later as the captain makes it 2-0 in as many minutes!</p>
<p><strong>13:26</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Indoor Hockey Womens 2nd <strong>2-5</strong></p>
<p><strong>13:24</strong> It&#039;s all over at the frisbee as carter scores the last point.</p>
<p><strong>13:17</strong> Frisbee is 14-10, and this is the last point if Lancaster get it.</p>
<p><strong>13:14</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Final score <strong>5-2</strong></p>
<p><strong>13:13</strong> Frisbee 12-10 to Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>13:07</strong> Frisbee and it&#039;s 12-9 to Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>13:06</strong> 5-2 to Lancaster in the hockey thanks to a goal from Michaela Blakely.</p>
<p><strong>13:04</strong> Women&#039;s hockey, Lancaster make it 4-2 through Sacha Du Chars from a short corner and surely that&#039;s game over now.</p>
<p><strong>13:02</strong> Mixed frisbee and York have scored another two points to make it 11-9.</p>
<p><strong>12:59</strong> Women&#039;s hockey. Time is ticking down and York need to capitalise on their dominance.</p>
<p><strong>12:58</strong> Frisbee. 11-7 to Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>12:55</strong> Women&#039;s hockey and early in the second half York score again from another short corner. 3-2 and the fightback is on.</p>
<p><strong>12:53</strong> York have pulled another 2 back in mixed frisbee to make it 9-7.</p>
<p><strong>12:52</strong> Mixed frisbee and it&#039;s 9-5 to Lancaster. Lancaster are called &quot;the fish&quot; for some long-winded reason involving alcohol.</p>
<p><strong>12:51</strong> Women&#039;s hockey score is 3-1 to Lancaster. Half time. Correction to the overall score: it&#039;s currently 17-6 to Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>12:50</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster" /> Now 9-5 in the frisbee and York appears to have crumbled a little. 3-1 to Lancaster in women&#039;s hockey at half time. York doesn&#039;t seem to be faring well in the later stages of these matches.</p>
<p><strong>12:48</strong> Frisbee and it&#039;s another point to Lancaster. 9-4.</p>
<p><strong>12:44</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster" /> Half-time in the outdoor frisbee and it&#039;s currently 6-4 to Lancaster, despite an early lead.</p>
<p><strong>12:43</strong> Mixed frisbee is getting competitive. Lancaster are at 8-4.</p>
<p><strong>12:40</strong> Women&#039;s hockey and Lancaster equalise through Becky Griffin. 1-1</p>
<p><strong>12:39</strong> Mixed frisbee and it&#039;s 7-4 to Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>12:38</strong> But York&#039;s Sally Warrington scores after a poorly defended short corner. 1-0 York.</p>
<p><strong>12:37</strong> Lancaster are a league above York and had a better BUCS season and with home advantage to boot they&#039;re certainly favourites.</p>
<p><strong>20:05</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster Win" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Indoor Football Womens 1st <strong>1-2</strong></p>

<p><strong>12:24</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> End of the match and the first Friday victory for York. Final score <strong>4-2</strong></p>
<p><strong>12:20</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> 3-1 to York in the ultimate frisbee so far. 4-2 to York in the indoor football. Neither match has finished but York is pulling back from a series of early losses.</p>
<p><strong>12:14</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> 2-1 now to York. Lancaster don&#039;t look strong but a penalty pulls a goal back for them.</p>
<p><strong>12:11</strong> First injury of Roses. Dan Turley of York limps off after a heavy challenge.</p>
<p><strong>12:10</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> York are leading at half-time in the Men&#039;s 1st indoor football. Only 1-0 at the moment but possibility for York&#039;s first Friday victory.</p>
<p><strong>12:09</strong> Half time is 1-0 York. Very tight game, could go either way! Also Lancaster massive shout for a penalty but ignored by otherwise perfect referee.</p>
<p><strong>12:06</strong> York penalty for Lancaster keeper out of area. Ash Daley scores 1-0 York.</p>
<p><strong>12:00</strong> York keeper David Ambra is under fire but pulling off some marvellous rates to keep a clean sheet.</p>
<p><strong>11:59</strong> Emily Scott says she enjoyed the football but just wishes she could have been of more use.</p>
<p><strong>11:53</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Lancaster win despite a late York goal. Overall, Lancaster have won the indoor football despite Men&#039;s 1st remaining. <strong>2-1</strong></p>
<p><strong>11:52</strong> Full time whistle. Women&#039;s team lose 2-1 and it&#039;s up to the Men&#039;s 1sts to avoid a whitewash in the five-a-side football.</p>
<p><strong>11:46</strong> York should&#039;ve levelled them through Gaby Stewart.</p>
<p><strong>11:45</strong> Another York penalty. Katy Ballantyne scores and York are back in this at 2-1 down.</p>
<p><strong>11:42</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster" /><strong>OVERALL ROSES SCORE SO FAR: 15-4 to Lancaster</strong></p>
<p><strong>11:41</strong> Lots of spectators now and plenty of unrepeatable Lancaster chants.</p>
<p><strong>11:41</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Lancaster continued to dominate the indoor football and win another point. Score: <strong>6-1</strong></p>
<p><strong>11:40</strong> Half time. York should be drawing and will regret that penalty miss.</p>
<p><strong>11:39</strong> York penalty but Sarah Milner hits the post.</p>
<p><strong>11:39</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Lancaster dominate York in a well-deserved win - of another lone point. Final Score <strong>3-0</strong></p>
<p><strong>11:36</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Lancaster win a point in the Men&#039;s 3rds indoor football. Despite York taking an early lead, the final score was <strong>5-1</strong> to Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>11:29</strong> And Sue Wynes scores again from a distance. 2-0</p>
<p><strong>11:27</strong> Women&#039;s 1sts kick off. Lancaster&#039;s Vice President of Sport is playing up front and scores a penalty straight away! 1-0 Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>11:20</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> York win the Men&#039;s 1st cricket. Won in the final over <strong>190-188</strong></p>
<p><strong>11:19</strong> Full time.</p>
<p><strong>11:19</strong> York captain Angus O&#039;Brien gets a consolation goal 6-2</p>
<p><strong>11:17</strong> Si Thompson claims the match call with a hattrick to make it 6-1</p>
<p><strong>11:07</strong> York score, but disallowed for going into the orange goalkeeping area. Half time, 2-1 Lancaster. Very even match atm.</p>
<p><strong>11:05</strong> York pull one back through Alexandre Petitcolline 2-1</p>
<p><strong>11:03</strong> Make that 2-0 from Si Thompson.</p>
<p><strong>11:02</strong> Lancaster score, Jack Griffiths 1-0</p>
<p><strong>10:55</strong> York men&#039;s 2nds is the same squad as the 3rds because there aren&#039;t enough players. They&#039;re already tired and got beaten 5 - 1 by Lancaster 3rds. Prediction: Lancaster massive win.</p>
<p><strong>10:50</strong> Women&#039;s football 2nds. Still 3 - 0. Goals so far scored by Lancaster&#039;s Holly Butler and a penalty from Thompson.</p>
<p><strong>10:46</strong> Women&#039;s football 2nds. York 3 - 0 down. Emily Scott playing.</p>
<p><strong>10:43</strong> Men&#039;s thirds football. York 1 - 5 Lancaster. Frantic match!</p>
<p><strong>10:40</strong> Sorry everyone, we&#039;ve been having problems with lancastrian internet, hopefully it&#039;ll work now!</p>
<p><strong>08:07</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_lancashire.png" alt="Lancaster" /> <strong>Lancaster Win!</strong> Lancaster awarded 12 points due to York forfeiting the rowing. Initial Score Lancaster <strong>0-1</strong></p>
<p><strong>10:53</strong> <img src="../../images/version2/rose_yorkshire.png" alt="York Win" /> <strong>York Win!</strong> Cricket Mens 1sts <strong>192-188</strong></p>
