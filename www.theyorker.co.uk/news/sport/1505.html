		<div class="SubText">UCLAN 3 - 3 York aet (York win 7-6 on penalties)</div>

        <p><strong>York men&#039;s football 2nds beat UCLAN 2nds on penalties after an eventful 3-3 draw in normal time. An own goal and two from striker Dan Cox helped drag York back in a game they never led, until Lewis&#039;s decisive penalty in the shoot-out.</strong></p>
<p>On a beautiful Wednesday afternoon, University of York 2nds stepped off the bus in Preston only to find they&#039;d be kicking off in 15 minutes because of a mix up with directions. Despite this setback, skipper Remington tried to organise a warm-up of decent standards after poor starts in previous games had cost the team dear. This intervention had no bearing on the customary shoddy start however when a long throw-in from the sideline was hurled straight at keeper Taylor, only for the McCririck of the club to touch the ball straight into the goal. This long-throw would continue to unsettle York all game and another chance fell minutes later, only for the defence to clear the ball. The UCLAN team who played in the equivalent league of York&#039;s 1sts dominated the early stages with possession and chances which the strikers failed to take. The &#039;Kevin Davies&#039; of the opposition was dominating aerially as man-markers Lewis and Grayland failed to cope.</p>
<p>However, York began to form some passing moves between the midfield three of Johnson, Ramsden and Molyneux. This was to no avail when midway through the first half a set-piece resulted in a UCLAN midfielder charging through on goal. When Lewis tracked back and made the cleanest, sexiest and perhaps best tackle ever, the referee controversially awarded a penalty. Despite the foul mouth protests of Ramsden the referee stuck with his decision and the same midfielder struck the ball into the right hand side of the goal.</p>
<p>This act of detestable decision making woke the York team up and some decent football was starting to be played when the ball was hit to the quick feet of Cox and Silson up front. With the UCLAN team playing a 4-4-2, Edwards and Remington were having to track the opposition&#039;s wingers which freed up more space for Johnson to liberate. With Ramsden marking the &#039;best player on the pitch&#039; in midfield, Molyneux was the man attempting to create openings for the front two.</p>
<p>Taylor kept the team in the game with a quadruple save off a set-piece which captain described later as a &#039;fat man rolling about&#039; which resulted in him swatting the ball out of play. He again kept the ball out of the net when a clear opening for the UCLAN striker ended up with a scuffed finish and the ball in Taylor&#039;s hands.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the first half a corner was won and with gargantuan Grayland attacking the ball Remington swung the ball in. The ball was bundled in somehow; either off the man&#039;s elbow, buttocks or his marker but Grayland claimed the plaudits.</p>
<p>Minutes later the referee blew his biased whistle and troops marched in for Remington&#039;s wise words. Despite not having the motivational speeches of Broadhurst, the 2nd team skipper was more analytical of the team and his tactical know-how brought forward the proposition that the team had &#039;no subs&#039; and that &#039;everyone is going to have to play the whole game&#039;.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>This Mourinhoesque philosophy proved fruitful as York had the best of the opening exchanges of the first half. Although, UCLAN were continuing to dominate possession, the next goal was to go to the Whites of York. Cox and Silson exchanged passes and laid the ball back to the aerodynamic Molyneux who split the defence with an incisive pass. Cox raced through the defence and rounded the keeper with a nonchalant pass into the net to finish the move.</p>
<p>UCLAN were creating chances but none clear cut with the marshalling of Swan at the back the key to the whole game. Set-pieces were where UCLAN looked most dangerous and this proved to be their breakthrough when another long throw-in caused problems in the box and a scramble resulted in a simple finish and the lead for Reds of UCLAN. Although some heads dropped in the team, Dan Cox&rsquo;s did not. Straight from the restart the gentle giant jinked through three men played a neat one-two with Silson and passed the ball into the net from 25 yards much to the disappointment of the UCLAN crowd.</p>
<p>Both teams pressed on looking for a winner for the remainder of the match but the battling three at the back didn&#039;t give the UCLAN strikers a sniff and Cox and Silson only had long-balls to deal with. The one remaining chance of the match ended up with Taylor dropping on the ball when the red striker couldn&#039;t get the ball out of his feet from a throw-in.</p>
<p>Extra-time brought much of the same and with both teams tiring, the looming threat of penalties was inevitable. This was where the team with the biggest cahones would succeed, not necessarily the best one. Unfortunately there were very few big balled players in the York side as Remington had to pick players who didn&#039;t want to step-up to the mark. The testosterone fuelled captain had to go first and confidently stepped up to the spot. Remington&rsquo;s kick was sent flailing wide however, as he was still in hoofing goal kick mode.

</div></blockquote><p>The UCLAN penalty taker of the first half slotted the ball into the net with ease. Edwards then took the long walk up to the spot only to scuff the kick into the keeper&#039;s grateful arms. Again UCLAN scored to take a 2-0 lead. However, the next three penalties were all scored by York with Johnson, Swan and Grayland striking the ball with class. Two top-class saves from Taylor with the last two takers took York into sudden-death.</p>
<p>Strikers Cox and Silson and box-to-box midfielder Ramsden put the ball away confidently with the 6th, 7th and 8th penalties as did the UCLAN players. With a double-decker bus full of school kids watching the penalties from behind the goal the pressure was now really on. Molyneux couldn&#039;t hack it as his scuffed effort was saved. The previous penalty was also missed by UCLAN however, which sent the tie into the 10th round of penalties. The UCLAN defender stepped up only to blaze the ball past the bus and more importantly wide of the goal. Lewis stepped up to the spot and struck the penalty straight down the middle of the goal which the keeper palmed but couldn&#039;t stop from going into the net due to its sheer power and Ronaldo-like swerve. A jubilant set of players piled on top of the scorer and hero keeper Taylor.</p>
<p>Despite the UCLAN team having the majority of possession, chances and possibly ability the battling display of the 2nd team showed that they can compete with every team in their league and sends them into the next round of the NUL cup.</p>
<p><strong>MATCH RATINGS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Taylor:</strong> Kept the team in the game when it could have easily got out of their grasps. <strong>9/10 (MOM)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Swan:</strong> Marshalling display from the 2nd team player of the year. <strong>8</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lewis:</strong> Found the physical play of the strikers difficult but finished his penalty with ease. <strong>7</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grayland:</strong> No-one can beat this man in the air. Found the brute force of the strikers difficult to deal with as well. <strong>7</strong></p>
<p><strong>Edwards:</strong> Found it difficult to get into the game but showed his usual neat touches and determination to mark his man. <strong>7</strong></p>
<p><strong>Remington:</strong> Some horrible touches and didn&#039;t get into the game. Only a good score for his captaining display. <strong>7</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ramsden:</strong> Marked a quality player as best he could despite an early disappointment in missing out on the 1sts squad. <strong>8</strong></p>
<p><strong>Molyneux:</strong> Always looks like he&#039;s got so much time on the ball. Dribbling ability of Ronaldo at times. <strong>8</strong></p>
<p><strong>Johnson:</strong> Attempted to create chances for the front two, the luxurious player of the midfield three. <strong>7</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cox:</strong> Two goals of absolute class. Aerial ability a perfect complement to Silson&#039;s jinkiness.<strong>8</strong></p>
<p><strong>Silson:</strong> Despite a slight disadvantage in height in comparison to the UCLAN defenders worked hard, looked the most creative player in the team and worked his size 4 socks off .<strong>8</strong></p>

<p>were you watching the same game? we equalised 3 times rather than going 2-0 down, silson played in cox for his first goal and the third one straight from kick off was a move with johnson to ramsden to cox to the back of the net!</p>

<p>i resent the fact you make it sound like i was the only person protesting the penalty when the whole team was! plus as the comment above says we equalised 3 times! (and i took the pressure 6th penalty not the 8th!!)</p>
